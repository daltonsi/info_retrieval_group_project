Data: Twitter Data scraped from "Rouge" government accounts

Inspired by the recent trend of rouge government twitter accounts, we are interested in retrieving topic matter from these tweets.

The data was obtained by calling the Twitter API with twitter accounts found in this article:
While the accounts cannot be "verified", we took this article as a trusted source.

Our goal is to create a system that scans these tweets, ranking them by relevancy to the query and returning the top "N" tweets.

INSTRUCTIONS:
To run this program, in a Linux console, run twitstance.py
Once prompted, type in a topic of interest. Afterwards, you'll be prompted for how many results you would like to receive. Type in a numeric value.

After the results have been printed, you can either type in a new query, or EXIT to end the program.
