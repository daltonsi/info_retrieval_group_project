altusda,.@MartyIrby @David_Grimm Curious: what's the evidence that horse lawsuit was the cause? Vilsack didn't say that. USDA didn't say that.

altusda,@theRealMleh @AVMAvets Yep. People count on vets to protect animals. Disappointing.
altusda,@hdauria @AVMAvets An unprecedented attack on #transparency calls for a courageous response. Not this.
altusda,@Chirroyo @AVMAvets Very weak. One might say: Sad!
altusda,@karinchu @AVMAvets It's like they wanted to check the box that said they "expressed concern," but with a complete lack of conviction.
altusda,@RPrimoff Interesting thought.
altusda,@Stacemonger Next level!

altusda,@DelciannaW Pretty weak statement.
altusda,@chuckyoutwo Yeah. Who knew! I always assumed he had Trump's quantity of empathy: zero. But I guess he has a soft spot for animals.

alt_fda,@alt_fda Science is ever self correcting &amp; if U use science wrong, proper examples of use quickly arise &amp; include answers.
alt_fda,@alt_fda 
Sadly we know we have not convinced anyone in this thread but there is a lesson here.
alt_fda,@alt_fda If the answer was as easy as vaccines or 2nd hand smoke, science would have it by now.
alt_fda,@alt_fda &amp; this is the defining moment that a child develops autism from. $1Bn has been spent on autism research.
alt_fda,@alt_fda Yet environmental exposure 2 these chemicals is always higher than what is incurred in a vac. shot.
alt_fda,@alt_fda No one has ever said Johnny has autism because his parents smoked while he was a baby.
alt_fda,@alt_fda We have arguably had 2nd hand smoke longer than we have had vaccines &amp; yet we do not have generations of autism.
alt_fda,@alt_fda 
Here is a good wiki link. Note formaldehyde once again. https://t.co/zVbmZTLEWW?
alt_fda,@alt_fda We can universally agree that 2nd hand smoke is bad on all levels. Cigarette smoke contains some of the vaccine chem. + more.
alt_fda,@alt_fda Ok, let's address the exposure argument regarding the chemicals in vaccines. W/ another step of logic.
alt_fda,@alt_fda 
But that is not the argument, is it? These chemicals affect the child during vulnerable growth, causing autism.
alt_fda,@alt_fda U can see that we R already physically beyond the capacity of the shot 2 cause any measurable harm.
alt_fda,@alt_fda This SDS gives U an exposure limit of Formaldehyde https://t.co/Gd51mpBm2w (photo) note the dermal limit 4 death.
alt_fda,@alt_fda B it solids or liquids, it will eventually evaporate off. A liquid can only hold about 37% formaldehyde @ 1 atmosphere.
alt_fda,@alt_fda Formaldehyde in its natural form is gas. It's chemical structure allows it 2 B "contained" 4 short periods of time in other states.
alt_fda,@alt_fda Now consider the volume of the avg. vaccine shot &amp; some chemical limitations. Formaldehyde 4 example.
alt_fda,@alt_fda Now let's go back to the CDC chart. Those ingredients R listed like food. Most 2 least concentration.
alt_fda,@alt_fda 
SDS- Safety Data Sheet. These tell U how dangerous a chemical like baking soda or Formaldehyde is.
alt_fda,@alt_fda Let's address some terms first. OHSA- Occupational Health Safety Agn. They make sure your work is safe.

alt_fda,@alt_fda &amp; how he plans to move the FDA forward. #conmanpotus has no actual idea how hard it is 4 FDA 2 abandon proven science.
alt_fda,@alt_fda The real story will be in how he removes himself from his pharma ties to gain an impartial standing within the ind.
alt_fda,@alt_fda This is why it's not a huge story as industry is not up in arms with the notion of a radical outside appointee.

alt_fda,@Jillbles Not arguing use of biomarkers in therapy, that is their best use. I'm pointing out that they cannot b the only method 4 approval.
alt_fda,@Jillbles bio markers do allow targeted therapy &amp; r used like that now. It's when it's the only requirement that I'm stating.
alt_fda,@alt_fda Joe is arguing that he would like corps 2 b able 2 selectively decide that cocaine is once again good 4 tooth aches.
alt_fda,@alt_fda The FDA incorporates all these methods together into current trials 2 get the full picture of a drug &amp; its interactions.
alt_fda,@alt_fda These examples r on the extreme side but represent how each method was done in the past.
alt_fda,@alt_fda It does not address the migraines u have while on it. The long term study shows no liver damage &amp; drug X is approved.
alt_fda,@alt_fda Let's go back to method 1. It's in a long term study. The study is only looking at if drug X damages ur liver, it's target organ.
alt_fda,@alt_fda 4th- long term. This one would seem the best but it greatly depends on the study.
alt_fda,@alt_fda That however is not required in this method of approval. If drug X slows or stops ur cancer &amp; most don't die, it works.
alt_fda,@alt_fda As many ppl died from the chemo as they did from cancer then. It took concurrent &amp; post outcome studies to pull this data out.
alt_fda,@alt_fda Before long term studies of chemo treatments were undertaken, no 1 knew how much, when or what the limits were.
alt_fda,@alt_fda 3rd method- disease modification and modulation. Cancer treatments R an excellent example of this.
alt_fda,@alt_fda Drug X is still approved due to it being effective overall &amp; may end up with a dosing guidance later.
alt_fda,@alt_fda Years later U have a failing liver &amp; data, if looked at in review, shows Drug X is likely the cause.
alt_fda,@alt_fda Example for this approval method. U have chronic debilitating pain. Drug X is prescribed in a dose that lessens it.
alt_fda,@alt_fda 2nd method- improvement in clinical signs &amp; symptoms
alt_fda,@alt_fda Biomarker approval says that's ok, drug X works. Migraines may B outside factor as stress of the subject. No further testing needed
alt_fda,@alt_fda 
Test show reduction in bilirubin but U have debilitating migraines while taking drug X.
alt_fda,@alt_fda Let's give an example to how biomarkers would work. Treating jaundice w/ drug X.
alt_fda,@alt_fda The first method- Biomarkers. If U don't know what biomarkers r. 
https://t.co/Q3fjsIHpyL
alt_fda,@alt_fda Now that U R up to speed let's skip ahead in the article 2 address the 4 proposed drug approvals Joe wants.

alt_fda,@alt_fda Due 2 all of this we would argue that protection is where we need to focus &amp; if U want a faster FDA, modernize us.
alt_fda,@alt_fda We are on the verge of individual directed drug treatments &amp; the FDA is still processing/ managing data w/ 20th century tech.
alt_fda,@alt_fda Computer processing &amp; tech now allow companies the ability to pursue an ever increasing variety of complex drug formulations.
alt_fda,@alt_fda Many drugs are stopped even before a beaker gets wet because they do not fit a profit model.
alt_fda,@alt_fda They are also being used for cost analysis or producing a drug. Including potential suit cost &amp; profit margins.
alt_fda,@alt_fda Statistical models can calculate not only potential drug hazards with current data set sizes by incorporating old data...
alt_fda,@alt_fda We r in great need of nxt gen antibiotics but profits cannot B realized from those currently.
alt_fda,@alt_fda Marketing is driving drug production at all levels in the industry.
alt_fda,@alt_fda 
Companies are mining big data to find potential drug markets. This the lead in speciality drugs, not need.
alt_fda,@alt_fda 2- Emergence of big data, statistical modeling &amp; computers/ tech. At no other time have we had the ability 2 process big data.
alt_fda,@alt_fda Each change of asset opens potential 4 violations.
alt_fda,@alt_fda 1- growth in the industry is currently artificial. Companies r purchasing &amp; divesting for profits.
alt_fda,@alt_fda Currently there are 2 major changes going on in the pharma industry that require a protection stand point.
alt_fda,@alt_fda Here is a time line of significant FDA moments in history. https://t.co/ngISbw3zc4 In it U can see the change in responses 2 need.
alt_fda,@alt_fda The FDA has shifted from protection 2 promotion 2 protection... over its life in response 2 regulation needs.
alt_fda,@alt_fda 2 say that there is a lack of historical context here is obvious &amp; makes 4 a "false flag" argument 2 advance from.
alt_fda,@alt_fda Back 2 R discussion from yesterday. Joe starts out by calling 4 a shift in FDA focus. From protecting health 2 promoting.

alt_fda,@alt_fda 
It is doubtful that these reductions in cost here will B fully passed onto the consumer.
alt_fda,@alt_fda This will reduce the bottom line 4 companies while minimizing first lines of defense.
alt_fda,@alt_fda While de-reg may start with us, it will end up in QC/QA depts. of companies.
alt_fda,@alt_fda QC &amp; QA (quality control &amp; quality assurance) depts industry wide R non-value added assets. I.E. they R cost centers on the books.
alt_fda,@alt_fda The customers that Joe is speaking of is not the purchaser of the products, it's the stock holders &amp; company's value in profits.
alt_fda,@alt_fda This is going to sound jaded but those of you on the corporate side of pharma will back us up.
alt_fda,@alt_fda Let's start this discussion with a framing that Joe would like "market-centric" &amp; providing better value to customers.
alt_fda,@alt_fda The article states that Joe is probably the likely contender for the job. He is working the art of the deal with POTUS.

alt_fda,@alt_fda Would prices go up? Yes because real drugs cost more than house plant.  

#themoreyouknow
alt_fda,@alt_fda The vitamin &amp; supplement market would not disappear &amp; u would be healthy 4 it.
alt_fda,@alt_fda There would be companies that r positioned 2 instantly meet the regulations.
alt_fda,@alt_fda Where does the industry stand at this point. In 3 words, with venture capitalist. If the regs came into law 2day.
alt_fda,@alt_fda Remember the FSMA act? We discussed yesterday? Here's the link. https://t.co/NMGfYi1Ng3
alt_fda,@alt_fda Or, alt. idea, we could fully move vitamins &amp; supplements under the food regs &amp; finally gain full control of them. #crazythought
alt_fda,@alt_fda So, what r the solutions to this? The FDA could try again to bring them under pharma rules again. That seems like an instant fail.
alt_fda,@alt_fda ...but we cannot stop you from skinning your knee. Only look at it later. Then look at where &amp; why it happened. Maybe stop it then.
alt_fda,@alt_fda Currently the FDA can be described as having "School Nurse" status. We know all about the playground but...
alt_fda,@alt_fda In 2012 the FDA tried again and once again Senator Orrin G. Hatch pushed back. No advancement in the law was made.
alt_fda,@alt_fda This was squashed by Senator Orrin G. Hatch who wrote a far less reaching law that was enacted instead.
alt_fda,@alt_fda Some history, in 1994 the FDA wanted to enact regulations that would bring vitamins &amp; supplements under the pharma laws.
alt_fda,@nytimes https://t.co/1BzoRfgV50 Note the response of the first company.

alt_fda,@alt_fda Supplements and Vitamins are close in regulation to food but without all of the good controls food regs have.

alt_fda,@alt_fda Those not in pharma a guidance is when ur mate sees what U R doing &amp; then says...
alt_fda,@alt_fda Those that are in pharma understand how every time you hear the word guidance, you also hear General Ackbar "It's a Traaaaap".
alt_fda,@alt_fda The FDA on its part has only come so far in understanding this. The main problems are in reporting &amp; guidance.
alt_fda,@alt_fda The Food ind. did not &amp; is no longer speaking the same language of tracking, testing &amp; reporting.
alt_fda,@alt_fda This however is where problems come. Pharma evolved with the FDA in tracking, approving &amp; testing products from raw 2 finished.

alt_fda,@IdealistAmerica Probably not at this time. It's hard to say.
alt_fda,@reason_rising do you mean in the plant? It's a naturally occurring compound. PEG is in almost all commercial e-cigs. It's very stable.
alt_fda,@ariherzog yes, to keep all the tweets in a linking series.
alt_fda,@alt_fda With that we R done talking about #vaping. Take ur arm pit crystal &amp; essential oils &amp; learn to be safer. K? #protectyourself
alt_fda,@alt_fda Do you feel safe putting your life in the hands of a guy with plastic equipment &amp; a pickle jar? That's what was going on.
alt_fda,@alt_fda Are you understanding now what the regs are after? They are asking these and many more questions to keep you safe.
alt_fda,@alt_fda Is ur maker trained in science? Can they tell U what a meniscus is? How 2 calculate dilutions? Or is @BillNye just a guy?
alt_fda,@alt_fda Is the flavoring ethanol based? We're not fans of vaporizing any flammable liquid next to R face, R U?
alt_fda,@alt_fda About the flavoring, is it food safe &amp; what's it's dilution recommendations? Improperly diluted, It can burn U like a hot pocket!
alt_fda,@alt_fda Is the diluent certified food grade or it just doesn't say? Is licking a water fountain safe? Same question...
alt_fda,@alt_fda What is the diluent for the nicotine? PEG, EG, H2O? One is in toothpaste, one is in ur car &amp; hopefully the last is in U.
alt_fda,@alt_fda R they using a balance 2 weigh the nicotine? Is it calibrated &amp; tracked 4 certification? R they weighing within 10% of its limits?
alt_fda,@alt_fda What lab ware R they using in the prep? Is it class A or a good pickle jar. Class A has certified measurements, pickle jars don't.
alt_fda,@alt_fda What purity is the sellers nicotine? Does it come with a CoA? Purity dictates the dissolution. Sellers should know what a CoA is.
alt_fda,@alt_fda What is the lethal dose of pure nicotine? It's 30-80mg FYI. Or less than a baby aspirin.
alt_fda,@alt_fda We R going to assume U R buying ur e-juice &amp; will be asking Q's that you should be asking ur seller.
alt_fda,@alt_fda Making e-juice is not like mixing essential oils. Miss calculations do compound and you will alter your DNA by being dead.
alt_fda,@alt_fda First off the vaping regs were not designed to empower big tobacco. Their intent is to protect you from untrained blenders.
alt_fda,@alt_fda We do find this topic tiresome &amp; R going to B snarky about it. So, let's discuss vaping once &amp; then move on, shall we?

alt_fda,@StubbornOldBuzz keep trying, change is in the wind.
alt_fda,@PoetQs The life of a patent is a large amount of time to make a profit from.
alt_fda,@StubbornOldBuzz That is a different fight by different ppl.
alt_fda,@falling_stone true
alt_fda,@SchorJudith yes, but because they own the original patent they can call it a reformulation and keep it off the generic list.
alt_fda,@alt_fda This sometimes prevents the drug from entering the generic market there by lowering cost.
alt_fda,@alt_fda 3- Single patent filing. Before a drug comes off patent, drug makers will file new formulations to re-issue the patent.
alt_fda,@alt_fda A drug w/ isomers in the formulation may treat something completely different but will not be explored due 2 its patent listing.
alt_fda,@alt_fda This burdens the Patent Office for approval as they have to search all of these to prevent patent infringement.
alt_fda,@alt_fda These formulations are never proven to be the same chemical compound.
alt_fda,@alt_fda These "alternate" formulations are used to hinder competition with endless patent infringement lawsuits.
alt_fda,@alt_fda 2- Proven formulation patents. Pharma will sometimes include 100 chemical formulations 4 the same drug in a patent.
alt_fda,@alt_fda 
Without an increase in sample sets and trial sizes, we will not know which until after the drug hits the market.
alt_fda,@alt_fda @alt_fda these outlying data points often predict trends that are not seen without time or amount of use. They could be good or bad
alt_fda,@alt_fda 1- Study sizes need to increase. A shorter study at current size requirements downplays outlying data points.

ActualEPAFacts,It was determined that Trump was spreading false information.
ActualEPAFacts,At one point, a Congressman actually read aloud one of the Tweets to clarify.
ActualEPAFacts,His @Potus account was giving blow by blow misinformation of the hearing and what Comey said on the record.
ActualEPAFacts,We know that even as the intelligence committee was questioning FBI Director Comey, Trump was spreading lies.
ActualEPAFacts,Today we learned what we had suspected: the administration was/is under investigation for acts that can only be described as treasonous.
ActualEPAFacts,We are proud to be a part of this new wave of activism but would rather have had 45 nipped in the bud.
ActualEPAFacts,His election, transition and first days of office were fraught with tension that spearheaded a new generation of activists.
ActualEPAFacts,We went through the election hearing all about the criminal investigation HRC was under but never about the FBI investigation of Trump.
ActualEPAFacts,We knew that there were a lot of things going on that, for some reason, the FBI didn‚Äôt make us aware of.

ActualEPAFacts,"I have no information that supports those tweets." Comey states on behalf of the FBI AND the DOJ.

ActualEPAFacts,What suggestions would you all make to nip this behavior in the bud before it develops? END
ActualEPAFacts,^^^^^^ Notable mistaken patriarchal language. We teach this to our kids of all genders. 19
ActualEPAFacts,Telling my son not to put his hands on anyone in a way that makes them uncomfortable and stopping the first time they ask is key to me. 18
ActualEPAFacts,@WomanTheHellUp Same
ActualEPAFacts,@OregonPerson @GirlFuturist @jenannie It happened to my sister. She got suspended. My parents weren't as cool.
ActualEPAFacts,It's hard to dance that line of letting kids make mistakes and teaching them right from wrong. I get that. That's why this shook me. 17
ActualEPAFacts,Little things compound until something happens that is completely unacceptable and they cannot see why. 16
ActualEPAFacts,My point is that beginning at a young age, so many kids are desensitized to right and wrong by everyone. Parents, teachers, society... 15
ActualEPAFacts,His parents were there but not watching him (at school events this tends to be the norm on the playground) 14
ActualEPAFacts,He was spoken to by several parents at the game, myself included, and acted incredulous each time as though he hadn't done it. 13
ActualEPAFacts,Yesterday there was a boy at a school event who was doing something he shouldn't have been (crossing a line that said do not cross) 12
ActualEPAFacts,Most of his friends are good kids as well. A few of them, however, are entitled and undisciplined. 11
ActualEPAFacts,The reason this shakes me to my core is not only because I have daughters but because I have a son as well. He is kind, loving and good. 10
ActualEPAFacts,Boys will be boys is not an acceptable excuse, attitude or comment, in my opinion. 9
ActualEPAFacts,It starts from childhood where little girls are encouraged to be well behaved and young men are often shrugged off. 8
ActualEPAFacts,Something in my guy tells me that more women in this country are like my second daughter. 7
ActualEPAFacts,One would have likely done exactly as the girl in this story did while one would likely have stuffed her emotions and cried about it later 6
ActualEPAFacts,I know for a fact that my daughters would each handle this situation differently 5

ActualEPAFacts,You have no place to make her decide between the child you forced her to carry for nine months and the future she has worked for.

ActualEPAFacts,Unless the answer to those ?'s are that you will be fighting beside her for her success and supporting her, you have no place to speak now.
ActualEPAFacts,Where will you be when the emotional needs of a child are wearing on her and the financial needs are drowning her?

ActualEPAFacts,We love your commentary @ChrisMurphyCT. We made your rant into a thread. We appreciate you. May want to RT this so‚Ä¶ https://t.co/GOALKZzlX7
ActualEPAFacts,(6) Last rant, for now. If you're older, your premiums go WAY up. GOP plan guts premium protections for older consumers.
ActualEPAFacts,(5) Oh, and Medicaid expansion is effectively GONE. Millions and millions lose coverage, start using ERs again for health care. Others die.
ActualEPAFacts,(4) Mandatory benefits are repealed. So even if you CAN get insurance, it doesn't have to cover ANYTHING. Out of pocket expenses skyrocket.
ActualEPAFacts,(3) Coverage mandates and penalties only work if you make insurance affordable. GOP plan cuts subsidies so much that penalty is unworkable.
ActualEPAFacts,(2) It gets worse. When u can't afford your premiums bc the tax credit is too small, you get a huge penalty when you try to sign up again.
ActualEPAFacts,(1) You get a couple thousand bucks to help u buy insurance. That's it. If u aren't rich or healthy, u won't be able to afford anything.
ActualEPAFacts,Let me count thy ways that the leaked GOP ACA repeal plan will totally, completely, monumentally screw you. @ChrisMurphyCT
