RoguePOTUSStaff,RT @RoguePOTUSStaff: @EmmaKennedy has indisputable evidence that we are fake. Send her a DM and she'll spill the beans.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@moiness If it's some kind of joke (she's a comedian after all) then bring on the fun for everyone.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@moiness We honestly want her to tell everyone her theory.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@joegibney15 @EmmaKennedy Then why did she?
RoguePOTUSStaff,@LukeyPookee One problem. We keep telling people to ignore the distractions and focus on what matters. IE Russian control, bad policy, etc.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@richclements Shaming? All we did was tell everyone what she's said. We'll let everyone make up their own mind about her theory.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@TheBlackShuck Cool story. Did you need help unfollowing?
RoguePOTUSStaff,@EmmaKennedy has indisputable evidence that we are fake. Send her a DM and she'll spill the beans.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@EmmaKennedy @wayneteeger Wow, that's some nasty name calling over someone simply applying critical thinking to your claim. #whysotouchy
RoguePOTUSStaff,@nandersnicnac On one hand we're curious what half cooked theory we'll here this time. On the other hand, we're tired of trolls.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@EmmaKennedy Diff between what we know &amp; what we can divulge. Sus. you're assuming wrong tone. Or that you don't know as much as you think.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@wilcrunk Earshot isn't always line of sight.
RoguePOTUSStaff,Spicer: "I wish he'd have an affair.  That'd be better than defending the stupid s*** he says in Twitter."
RoguePOTUSStaff,Is this account legit? https://t.co/cMiWztl2MX
RoguePOTUSStaff,@trvlfearlessly Congresspersons, not POTUS.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@KevinHardest Thanks for the info. We'll be sure not to vote for him.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@CStarkRaving Misunderstand. EVERYTHING done against Obama was POTUS attempt at revenge.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@Venusaur88 Well, nothing satirical about that.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@lando_thedead This question implies more logic than is present.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@indelible_inc It appears POTUS first angered early in Obama's term, b/c Obama wouldn't be bought. POTUS been on revenge trail ever since.
RoguePOTUSStaff,It's not just rhetoric. POTUS actually wants to find out what Obama "has on them" regarding Congressional opponents to new HC bill.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@Roguemom1 This may simply be preemptive move to prevent others from using POTUS' name in such ways in China.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@Roguemom1 Don't rush to assumptions. We understand that POTUS name has been trademarked by many in China with nefarious goals. (cont)
RoguePOTUSStaff,@DJsixseven FISA warrant covered a server.  There were no wiretaps. Clapper's statement was accurate. @justinhendrix is confused.
RoguePOTUSStaff,Sorry, but we have to ask.....is this account legit? https://t.co/vv24FE4uZG
RoguePOTUSStaff,RT @LindseyGrahamSC: An attack on one political party should be considered an attack on all. We must push back on Russian election interfer…
RoguePOTUSStaff,@kirheft Frustrated he doesn't have freedom to do his job. Thought he would be advising POTUS. Instead, he just smiles and nods.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@fake_dante Correct, but you're still calling ducks geese. "Fact checking" baseless absurdities says they are news. It legitimizes nonsense.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@fake_dante Would accurately call it tabloid nonsense. Not falsely label it as legitimate. The story isn't the accusation, it's the source.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@fake_dante If media take accuracy seriously then wouldn't be treating tabloid conspiracy theories as legitimate news topics.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@fake_dante So now, media has paved the way for tabloid trash to be normalized as news. All because you can't directly call a duck a duck.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@fake_dante As a result, the media looks dishonest because all you offer anymore is insinuation. The very style raises suspicion by default.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@fake_dante Instead, the media spends time trying to "hint" at facts, thinking that nobody realizes that you're just dropping hints.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@fake_dante This is why media has "credibility issues." Because you've lost the ability to call obvious nonsense the nonsense it is.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@fake_dante What is there to research? When POTUS (inaccurately) quotes tabloids, what is so hard about treating it accordingly?
RoguePOTUSStaff,@Bunsia We kind of wish Spicer had no tie today. He really needs to learn how to tie a knot.
RoguePOTUSStaff,Tillerson may be regretting his new job already. Doesn't like being reduced to being POTUS figurehead.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@MikeOfTomorrow Meanwhile, here's a rabbit we pulled out of our hats.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@MikeOfTomorrow The facts are that POTUS is using tabloid trash as intel source.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@christy_boyce We'd love to see a unicorn. But we must remain focused. But on feasible avenues to achieve success.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@danielsyiayia If you believe in innocence until proven guilty, why should media spend so much time trying to prove Obama innocent?
RoguePOTUSStaff,@christy_boyce *facepalm* wild guess....you mistakenly think "argumentum ad ignorantiam" is an insult. Look it up. Learn something.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@christy_boyce You should do a google search for "burden of proof" and "argumentum ad ignorantiam."
RoguePOTUSStaff,@CrouchPants People keep confusing emoluments clause with owning a business. You're barking up the wrong tree.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@GhettoThunderJS Except that according to reports, they are stealing people's designs and refuse to pay their partners.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@KatheleenMitro She just was throwing a hissy because we wouldn't tell her our IDs or give her an interview.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@StafferWh The only ppl who don't like RP are the anti-estab camps who are scapegoating. Priebus is actually main one holding WH together.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@SharonLeah8 The fact that POTUS is getting his classified information from tabloid rags.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@RichardLDodson Bingo. The headline should have been "POTUS misquotes trashy tabloid as intel source." Not "We await your generous info."
RoguePOTUSStaff,@WM_Bartle Because it's better to wax poetic about shadows, so that afterward 80% of them still believe what POTUS said?
RoguePOTUSStaff,@nurseswain If we even have to "pull threads" to figure that out, then we have bigger problems than POTUS.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@CaldronOfRage Have you been sleeping for the past two days?
RoguePOTUSStaff,@cinnyminny1227 More proof? If it's not evident on its face, then the only ones looking foolish are the ones looking for "more proof."
RoguePOTUSStaff,@MikeOfTomorrow This is the other thing wrong with this country. Everyone is so self righteous in their own partisanship.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@Prepare4Gr8ness Actually, by "investigating" it, the media is sending the message that the 2nd grader is a legitimate chess player.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@MoonChild44 This is the problem with our country today. We've lost the fortitude to dismiss absurdity out of hand. So now, we fall for it.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@celtic_traveler Forget about Obama.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@realDonaldTrump No we aren't.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@PurlLeslie Spending time to "disprove" claims creates an illusion of legitimacy. You don't spend time disproving fairy tales.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@RealGeoHilton Because it will make you feel good, but that's about it.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@christy_boyce Congratulations, you've just legitimized the false conspiracy theory.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@RealGeoHilton All the emoluments talk is nothing but mental masturbation.
RoguePOTUSStaff,And when you try you create a kind of existential import. The search for proof becomes a form proof. "Proof enough"… https://t.co/1zEwVhbtWx
RoguePOTUSStaff,@StevensonPaddy That mentality is one obsessed w/ the personal satisfaction of a "gotcha" moment. In the process, legitimizing the claim.
RoguePOTUSStaff,Media is treating wiretap claim like it's legitimate issue. They're investigating, looking for evidence. Call it what it is: A LIE.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@ButlerEA1 No.
RoguePOTUSStaff,Media needs to stop asking for basis of POTUS' claims &amp; start telling the truth about them. Obsessed w/ "gotcha" moment for their own goals.
RoguePOTUSStaff,POTUS taking wiretap chatter as a win. Once again, the public is distracted. And even the chatter aims at the wrong target.
RoguePOTUSStaff,Not saying the rumors about Priebus are true. But if they were, Reince owes Comey big time for diverting POTUS gaze. For now.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@glasgowliz58 It's all about scope.
RoguePOTUSStaff,POTUS wants Congress to be too busy looking for non-existent wiretap evidence that they can't investigate Russiagate.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@Adelheid_SCA You mean a two month old article? There's more to news than headlines.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@ReallyNoyb Ignore the trolls who lie to you saying the 25th amendment offers an avenue to remove POTUS. It's as bad as POTUS wiretap lie.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@itwitt2 Please be careful with such statements. That is right on the border of the kind of suggestion we cannot allow.
RoguePOTUSStaff,POTUS has tried to make the case that he had plan all along w/ wiretap, as distraction strategy. Only Miller [claims he] believes him.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@nairam3rd @BeeCallaway POTUS is the type who might decide that if he can't have you nobody will.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@mc_dorky Yes, we are.
RoguePOTUSStaff,About 95% of issues b/c of POTUS instructions. Yes, he's stacking w/ allies. Other option is Bannon/Miller allies. https://t.co/SkVZISZ83j
RoguePOTUSStaff,@kristihall1985 We've already gotten a DM from PETA complaining about our stigmatization of virtual birds.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@SveaVikander Oh, well that's convenient for escaping responsibility for what you've said. This Bud's for you:

https://t.co/Ix3IvSxej9
RoguePOTUSStaff,@minorcharacter Actually, we're being "combative" with ppl who just want to THEIR VERSION OF REALITY to be decreed as going on inside WH.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@HumanRacehorses Touche.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@Michael_Bearer Well, the bullied teenage cutter reference was so popular we figured we'd diversify species.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@HolstBarb We weren't talking about POTUS.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@Michael_Bearer He can't get revenge on media, so he's going self destructive. Like a captive bird pecking out its own feathers.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@ficyk5 We're not going to apologize for your own assumptions. Don't like it, then don't follow. Stop putting words in our mouths.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@addictionguy Don't care to hear obtuse excuses for why we should entertain people misrepresenting what we've said.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@ohmycelium Go troll somewhere else.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@SveaVikander Oh good, more willful ignorance. Misogyny? Are you drunk?
RoguePOTUSStaff,People who can't abstract beyond the 140 characters in front of their eyes shouldn't be on twitter.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@Nettkitten @PatColsher Glad some are getting it.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@KustomKael We didn't.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@jenny_cee2012 It's what we've been trying to say all night. But so many people are dedicated to faux outrage.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@Crayestout No need for those to be mutually exclusive.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@dearjan20 Clearly you want a partisan based double standard. You're in the wrong place for that. Oh, and we don't have "supporters."
RoguePOTUSStaff,@dearjan20 Why do you think we do this? Hint: we hate delusions and lies. If you choose to engage in those, we will attack you too.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@PatColsher Negative media coverage and being unable to punish media for it is an overwhelming feeling for POTUS.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@deseraestage Guess that shows the merit of your arguments. We won't miss you.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@deseraestage For someone who thinks herself an expert, you're more dense than lead. Willful ignorance is an ugly thing.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@deseraestage !!! Like....wanting to get revenge against media, but having no way to do so. That's a "difficult feeling" for POTUS.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@ribblefizz Another similar scenario is an abusive partner who threatens suicide to prevent you form leaving her/him. It's control attempt.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@ribblefizz has some kind of interest or obligation to your well being. Kinda like POTUS being arrogant enough to believe media needs him.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@ribblefizz More simply said, it's an attempt to gain control over one person by harming self, based on belief that the other person (cont)
RoguePOTUSStaff,@deseraestage foolish. Instead you've chosen willful ignorance, trying to misrepresent what we've said. you're no better than POTUS.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@deseraestage If you weren't so focused on reveling in your own self importance and faux expertise you might have avoided looking so (cont)
RoguePOTUSStaff,@deseraestage Coping mechanism? Like....coping w/ desire to exact revenge against media, but have no way to do so?
RoguePOTUSStaff,@dearjan20 you to unfollow us and go troll somewhere else. People like you are the reason this country is in this entire mess.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@dearjan20 If you are going to engage in willful ignorance and purposely misrepresent what we've said, then we are just as happy for (cont)
RoguePOTUSStaff,@dearjan20 you're the one who deligitimizes your own self. You don't get to decree that we are saying things that in fact we are not. (cont)
RoguePOTUSStaff,@dearjan20 If you want to be just as bad as POTUS, pretending that any subjective desire you express must be accepted as valid, then (cont)
RoguePOTUSStaff,@dearjan20 Why should we indulge your foolishness? Who are you? We reject foolishness from POTUS, we'll reject it from anyone else, too.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@deseraestage You need to be "careful" with the assumptions you put into other people's mouths.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@STFUnwo It wasn't meant to be funny. If you can't understand that, then just unfollow us. No patience people putting words in our mouths.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@omgitsjen As people having delusions shoved down our throats on daily basis, we find your straw man offensive to ourselves &amp; reality.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@omgitsjen Your insistence on misrepresenting what we said is what's offensive here. Go troll someone else.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@humgbrd111 We're saying that might be an actual &amp; real possibility. Not figurative. He may literally be near the end if his coping ability.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@ReallyaBM Recent.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@dearjan20 The falsity is the assumptions you are interjecting into our comment.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@CDReisswriter @dearjan20 You missed the point entirely.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@llinndssayy Compare prisoners using hunger strike in reaction to being traumatized by captors.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@MTYork02004 Yes, it's irrational. Kinda our point.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@omgitsjen Which is exactly what we said.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@PotusWant Yes, exactly. Is it really so difficult fire people to understand?
RoguePOTUSStaff,@CentralCoastFOG Tomato, tomato.
RoguePOTUSStaff,Seems to be LITERALLY using wire tap lies (KNOWING it makes him look worse) as substitute for hurting media in revenge for negative coverage
RoguePOTUSStaff,We're not making light of anything. POTUS seems actually traumatized by recent spate of Russiagate coverage. He can't cope right now.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@dearjan20 So, if a million people believe a false thing it's no longer false?
RoguePOTUSStaff,@AngRittenhouse OK. But that is not what we are saying. POTUS seems truly traumatized by the revenge negative coverage.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@dearjan20 Or maybe your assumptions are incorrect.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@staringispolite Alter your perspective. We're not making light. POTUS seems truly &amp; actually traumatized to that degree.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@TG626 Not getting the point. POTUS appears to be actually and literally traumatized.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@Scott_Beamer Who's mocking?
RoguePOTUSStaff,@shutuplegs2 Allegedly poised.
RoguePOTUSStaff,At this point POTUS' wire tap claim feeling akin to a teenage cutter hurting self as revenge for being picked on.
RoguePOTUSStaff,It appears that POTUS knows full well the phone tap claim is bogus. Seems to be a bitter attempt to get back at media for negative coverage.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@MAliceLynch That is not rule of law. That is rule of your personal satisfaction.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@CitizenX7766 @PalmerReport @Sheare_Bliss @RogerJStoneJr @RVAwonk No.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@gordonrios And why do people continue to justify egregious behaviors for the personal satisfaction of one day saying "told you so"?
RoguePOTUSStaff,@KRemainechau Why do people keep thinking that twitter is going to be the key to breaking open investigations?
RoguePOTUSStaff,RT @PalmerReport: We've reported Roger Stone @RogerJStoneJr to Twitter for his menacing sexist attack on @RVAwonk tonight. Clear violation…
RoguePOTUSStaff,@bmlzootown The same beast that ain't amused spelling/grammar nazi trolls.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@jpluther71 That's good, because we never had any care for you in the first place.
RoguePOTUSStaff,Moving to the White House, gonna hear alot of leaking.
Leaking's done by the hand, with secret phone when we can.... https://t.co/C1FIcuYvyf
RoguePOTUSStaff,@pbeachboy Well played. :)
RoguePOTUSStaff,@adolhancryk That pretty much covers 95% of WH staffers.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@Peggyporter50 Six weeks working in this admin, you might be too.
RoguePOTUSStaff,He's Trump
He's Trump
He's Trump
Out if his head.

He's Trump
He's Trump
He's Trump
In Russia's bed.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@DaveNeufer Then you aren't much better than POTUS. Accept reality. You don't get something just because you want it. We have rule of law.
RoguePOTUSStaff,#UnholyTrinity Seem seem to be more in "when" mode than "if." But must play the chess game just right. Has to be a… https://t.co/K6rFjQW7Qe
RoguePOTUSStaff,@eaglefeather4 Great. Apply that info here and stop trolling.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@eaglefeather4 Do your not understand the difference between a telephone and a server?
RoguePOTUSStaff,@eaglefeather4 Individually you seem obtuse. We know about server warrant. POTUS claimed phone tap. That would be separate. Thus, new info.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@Mac_isDemSugar 0
RoguePOTUSStaff,@lori_miley Because it has no application here.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@dieJanki No. Declassifying is a power vested in the office. EO are an instrument of wielding exec power, not a binding upon it.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@murraythebest Can confirm that at least some of us on this acct voted for POTUS, and none voted for Clinton.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@aarondhoffman Until he starts calling everyone to say they're "f*ing idiots" to blame then for his own messes. Like yesterday.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@Fenbeast FISA warrant was for computer server, not wiretapping phones. If POTUS' claim is true, that is more info.
RoguePOTUSStaff,A POTUS is the company s/he keeps keeps. https://t.co/g0eCrUawDg
RoguePOTUSStaff,@jammyyoon Fine. Then go live under your bed until then. While you're daydreaming your partisan fantasy land we'll be handling reality.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@nathenson No.
RoguePOTUSStaff,POTUS has done more damage to self in the 48 w/ his temper than has compromising news. No POTUS can survive scandal by alienating his staff.
RoguePOTUSStaff,Today has been the biggest failure of POTUS' term so far. Worst thing is, he doesn't even understand why. He's treading on very thin ice.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@LindenSchaffer We don't disagree. But even then, he knows is actions are wrong. He just doesn't care. He's still responsible.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@JustMarieSparks To understand what POTUS is thinking it's better to ask either David Copperfield, psychic hotlines, Jesus, or doctors.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@d_watters Opposing gender stereotypes identifies a person's gender? Please don't be so sexist. BTW, we are WE, not he or she.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@RacerWife7 We block for trolling, talk of violent/criminal activity (esp. toward POTUS or other gov figures), racism, sexism, etc.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@BryanPBMO Saying something is "mentally wrong" implies he's not responsible for himself. He knows he's doing wrong but does it anyway.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@BryanPBMO Still equating illness w/ choices. Only thing "wrong" with POTUS is that he chooses to engage in evil. His fault, not an illness.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@UKgnome Defame someone? That doesn't make sense.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@AubreyCole2014 Or the wife...
RoguePOTUSStaff,@suzimcm9 POTUS is reactive, not proactive.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@JZSamm Regardless, this invites opportunities for public/media to press the investigation. This can be used as instrument.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@mrk1223 That's what happens when you're constantly lying to hide your bad acts.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@BryanPBMO Do not confuse illness with bad behavior.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@n3benson Probably. ;)
RoguePOTUSStaff,@ayshipie More importantly, public statement about otherwise classified info can only be a declassification, or criminal leak.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@ayshipie POTUS power to declassify is basically absolute and inherent. If he wants to do it by taking out a billboard, he can. Or a tweet.
RoguePOTUSStaff,POTUS has legal right to release (i.e. declassify) classified info to public. BUT! Does that now make it subject to FOIA requests?
RoguePOTUSStaff,@JustMarieSparks We aren't magic.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@susanjones1968 Nothing. POTUS has absolute authority to release state secrets to public.
RoguePOTUSStaff,Was there a classified FISA warrant to tap his phone as part of a Russia investigation? Is POTUS tweeting classifie… https://t.co/8Zu7sxqflP
RoguePOTUSStaff,Past several days seem to have hit a nerve with POTUS. Running away yet again.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@kasi1222 "Asset" is more of an umbrella term. Be we should not get caught up in tomato, tomato games.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@silverlaced1 Intelligence is not required. In fact, a lack of intelligence improves chances an operative can recruit the potential agent.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@ElyseUU Have you been living under a rock?
RoguePOTUSStaff,@runsilent Please don't try use movie theater knowledge to correct things you don't actually understand.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@ruprecht32 Many people can't bring themselves to say the word. It's too real. And too serious. Living in denial b/c ignorance is bliss.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@patentology Sometimes agents can be recruited simply by being clever enough to dupe them into believe you are their friend.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@PinkSith No proof? Have you not been paying attention? Or is the problem that you're envisioning a James Bond movie? #thisisrealife
RoguePOTUSStaff,@theman83554 You seem to be confusing the movies with real life.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@aviatrixCR Being a "puppet" would make him an espionage agent.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@RangerClaymore Not being smart helps make it easier for him to be recruited and manipulated.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@DannyLenihan Actually, the dumb and/or gullible can be the easiest agents to recruit.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@lagunarex Have you heard about all the proof already? Problem is that most ppl won't recognize POTUS meets definition of espionage agent.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@natale962 No, we are merely stating fact that, because it's so serious, people don't want to believe it.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@chiefhornsteve If you have no doubt, then you agree that the duck is a duck. You just can't bring yourself to acknowledge the word.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@chiefhornsteve Because by def, that makes him an espionage agent. Evidence is all around us, you're just not seeing the seriousness of it.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@chiefhornsteve Do you doubt that POTUS is working with, or under control/manipulation of, Russia and Putin?
RoguePOTUSStaff,@RickCampbell12 Do you have any doubt that POTUS is secretly working with, or by control or manipulation of, Russia?
RoguePOTUSStaff,@vipertwosix The evidence is everywhere. But too few are willing to call it what it is.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@tnparalegal50 Actually, it's a simple statement. A simple statement that everyone has been trying to escape.
RoguePOTUSStaff,This cannot be understated: The President of the United States is a Russian espionage agent.
RoguePOTUSStaff,By definition, anyone secretly working against the country in favor, or the under control, of a foreign government, is a espionage agent.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@JoeOliver321 By definition, POTUS is a spy inasmuch he his being controlled by foreign government to the detriment of our own country.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@empirestatemind When infringed prop is directly sold (ex: a book, a tee shirt design) damages can be fixed as, at the least, total made.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@empirestatemind Stat. damages useful when infringement is no a resold item (ex: a logo), b/c act. damages would be difficult to quantify.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@empirestatemind Actual damages = total amount of money made from the infringement. In sit. like this easy to prove through discovery.
RoguePOTUSStaff,As of the end of February the debt was $12 billion MORE than when POTUS took office. Would you like media coverage… https://t.co/gWj7ix3tBN
RoguePOTUSStaff,@JoeOliver321 Well enough. But don't think you realize that there are no Obama people inside WH. Elsewhere in Exec Branch, but not in WH.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@JoeOliver321 Most of us are Republicans. And what makes us mad is a Russian spy and incompetent POTUS is in the oval office.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@MoK1118E Job loss? Definitely. Prosecution? Possibly. Black ops execution? Get real. That's a bad imitation of a bad imitation.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@MoK1118E Because this is nonsense. It's so over the top it's embarrassing. Nobody is going to kill a WH staffer to silence them. (cont)
RoguePOTUSStaff,@LadyJDance In this case, the simple principle of a staff leaker creating a dead man's switch is so over the top it's embarrassing.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@pesmerk Fake.
RoguePOTUSStaff,We live in dark times, but this is a reminder of the true America, and why we must protect our future.

https://t.co/7L8R6XJvwu
RoguePOTUSStaff,@DixieChick802 @RogueNASA  The verified @teespring is still there. Advertising resistance shirts on their TL, no less.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@Zyme_1 @danbock10 That is certainly far more accurate than the people complaining that we fail as "leakers."
RoguePOTUSStaff,@danbock10 We have before. And today, even (Sessions recusal). Still, we recommend getting news from the news, not twitter accounts.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@mhoffrob There are multiple kinds of damages. Statutory damages are different from ACTUAL damages.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@mhoffrob You may be thinking about trademarks.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@katecythr Not true. Copyright protections take effect immediately upon creation of a work.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@UniteBlueCA You mean castor oil, right?
RoguePOTUSStaff,@ljpne Yeah, we announced it an hour ago.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@dannybauder Do your parents know you're on the internet?
RoguePOTUSStaff,@NonnaSJF It wasn't a suggestion.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@whitehouserogue Validating a fake, busted for saying POTUS was eating corndogs &amp; watching Oscars when he was hosting Gov Ball. #yourefired
RoguePOTUSStaff,It's time for a recusal.
RoguePOTUSStaff,Do not tire. Do not fatigue. As long as our country is controlled by foreign agents we must continue to #resist and… https://t.co/pwvjnrDULx
RoguePOTUSStaff,@Signalnoise If they're stealing your design, a lawsuit can demand 100% of the resulting revenues as your damages. Just fyi.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@RogueNASA @TeespringHelp So many leeches trying to exploit others. Shame.
RoguePOTUSStaff,#UnholyTrinity wonder if Sessions to resigning might be the best option. Could help put the issue to bed sooner.
RoguePOTUSStaff,When everyone comes into the office, and nobody says anything, but everyone feels the anger and tension. #finetunedmachine
RoguePOTUSStaff,@kylersharp You need better priorities.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@altDoD_ @maxpower8122 False. Cabinet posts are subject only to const quals. IE, appointment by President, by and with consent of Senate.
RoguePOTUSStaff,https://t.co/eb0ZIykMnB
RoguePOTUSStaff,@marie_harl POTUS gets nervous when speaking because he doesn't know what he's doing. Refuses to admit it, though.
RoguePOTUSStaff,Read this carefully for the big picture behind POTUS trying to crush dissent among staff. #resist and #persist https://t.co/8Ommr4HVCL
RoguePOTUSStaff,@Golffan3 Truthfully, we're not social media people. Still not sure we understand twitter.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@Golffan3 Don't even understand what that means.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@mparton70 Long story short secret pictures from WW could constitute espionage. And sarcastic pictures seem to fall on deaf ears.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@mparton70 You must be new here.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@brocavin No. You're desperately off the mark. Problem is lobby firms hiring ppl before WH job is over. The article above explains it.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@barcadad Automation.
RoguePOTUSStaff,We can be followed on Facebook here:  https://t.co/l48FMXy9PB
RoguePOTUSStaff,@leisl103 Or maybe he's just dumb and evil.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@g_e_anderson Don't think you're understanding the point.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@brocavin Effectively no difference between two years or give years when insulating against lobbyist influence. https://t.co/93rsDMzbob
RoguePOTUSStaff,@chasehrlich Precisely, that's the point. He touts it as evidence that he is keeping promise to "drain the swamp."
RoguePOTUSStaff,Lately POTUS favorite "accomplishment" to boast to public is the lobbying ban. But it's the same protocol Obama and Bush enacted before him.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@SuzyEvans11 That's just silly. His problem is that he doesn't WANT to read. Reading means consuming new information. He doesn't like that.
RoguePOTUSStaff,Low expectations are also leading some top individuals to govern around, and in spite of, POTUS.

https://t.co/DsbVGDL01F
RoguePOTUSStaff,@g_e_anderson You "respect" gaslighting aggrandizement because you think it's a cheesy line?
RoguePOTUSStaff,@HippieCahier Well, we can confirm your reading comprehension skills are lacking. The point is POTUS' strategy, not naming technicalities.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@RyanJones Actually no simple answer to that Q. Often, an unofficial address like last night is used. But POTUS reasoning here is petty.
RoguePOTUSStaff,POTUS decided against SOTU 2017 b/c he won't say traditional "The state of our Union is strong" line until he can claim he "fixed" it first.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@leisl103 He's not dyslexic. That would be a legitimate illness. POTUS just chooses to be stupid.
RoguePOTUSStaff,While POTUS is proud of himself b/c "they loved me last night" others worry his speech will add fuel to his alleged reading deficiencies.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@TomWellborn We've been contacted to "finalize" deals some imposters are making, claiming to be us. Thus we feel it worth debunking them.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@AngryWHStaffer Deleting tweets is great, eh? Kinda like all those fake  memos you've deleted now that we pointed out how fake they were.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@CAlbrechtson Fake memos were gimmick of @angryWHstaffer . That is, until we pointed out flaws in their docs. They've since del them all.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@pelicanmeat Spelling erors kan be used to construkt a prophile, unless you inject and skadder randome errors;
RoguePOTUSStaff,@dayofroses Tweet was 9:30 pm EST. POTUS was showing off his stainless steel cuff links, trying to convince ppl they were stylish.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@lemasney Disturbingly, there's something plausible about that.
RoguePOTUSStaff,This is an odd tweet, seeing as POTUS was hosting a gala for the nation's governor's at time the Oscars were aired. https://t.co/VNkUiuAkmk
RoguePOTUSStaff,@RogueSNRadvisor Except that POTUS was actually hosting the Governors' Ball.
RoguePOTUSStaff,Just so we're clear, it's not Obama behind the leaks. Approx 50% of staffers are actively participating one way or another. #Iamtheleak
RoguePOTUSStaff,@galRogue 25(3r+y^4)/(sqrt17)
RoguePOTUSStaff,To state a tangent as the essence of a thing is the work of fools and liars. To convince the people as such is to destroy reality.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@SRuhle Your argument is all wrong. The $12B lie isn't about Obama. Fact is $12B is normal daily fluctuation. See week of 2/8 to 2/15.
RoguePOTUSStaff,Know why POTUS says his biggest weakness is giving the message? Because he's copying Obama.

RoguePOTUSStaff,@michellebhasin What we know is you are trying to put words in our mouth and gaslight us in much the same way as POTUS. We reject delusions.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@hojisitas Then please unfollow us. We have no interest in being watched by people engaging in racial bias and prejudice.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@michellebhasin We see nothing offensive about referencing classic movies.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@hojisitas You don't know the race of ppl using this acct. Suggest ending faux victimhood at things happening decades before you were born.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@michellebhasin If you can't see the equivocation between "I am the leak" and "I am Spartacus" then sorry, not sorry.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@bettyb00p00 Why should you resent it? You're not a slave.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@Boxy_Carmichael Just pointing out that it's actually faulty logic. It's affirming the consequent.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@Boxy_Carmichael Except that we already shed light on this fact back in. 

https://t.co/3Zi0EL57FF
RoguePOTUSStaff,@hojisitas Actually, it was a comparison to Roman slave gladiators. Try again. #learnyourhistory
RoguePOTUSStaff,Leak crackdowns cast staff as an enemy to management, and the slave are ready to revolt in solidarity. #Iamtheleak

RoguePOTUSStaff,When PressSec stress eats in anticipation of press briefings because POTUS insanity is too much you're running like a #finetunedmachine .
RoguePOTUSStaff,@naslacker Kinda like saying one tree is the source of autumn. There's a lot of pine in this White House, but there's a lot of oak, too.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@mytruself Spicer isn't incompetent. Problem is he's too smart to cope well with POTUS' nonsense. His job is to convince press 2+2=5.
RoguePOTUSStaff,Half the time Spicer is just doing what is demanded of him. And usually those things are absurd. Even Spicer has used Confide. #maybeheleaks
RoguePOTUSStaff,@GeorgeTakei The funny thing is that a heads up was basically leaked from legal, so some ppl walked into the office knowing what to expect.
RoguePOTUSStaff,POTUS backs investigating Yemen raid but thinks aim would be against low level military. Can't get it through his head that he messed up.
RoguePOTUSStaff,Walking through the door is a job in and of itself nowadays. Nonetheless, we #persist .
RoguePOTUSStaff,@jimmykimmel Oh, he's up.
RoguePOTUSStaff,Also, the Fed Records Actapplies to official comms, not personal comms from personal devices. And it doesn't cover leaking, either. Go fish.
RoguePOTUSStaff,Irony is the phone check plan was itself leaked, became known to select few, including us, and some who were in that interro--er, meeting.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@FMHilton Maybe nothing. Maybe anything. Maybe twitter apps. Maybe they just wanted to instill fear in people.
RoguePOTUSStaff,The Q to ask here is "How many leaks occur via text msg?" They weren't actually looking for evidence of media leaks. https://t.co/ZOoGwJYAdS
RoguePOTUSStaff,For someone who claims to hate the "fake" media, POTUS really is desperate to enlist allies to sell his propaganda to the media.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@SensorGuru We can confirm that person is fake, trying to imitate us.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@jaketapper Demolished. Much like the inner workings of the White House nowadays.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@Gia1952 Tell them your name is Petyr Baelish, and that your email is resisting@potusstaff.com .
RoguePOTUSStaff,@madameaction So don't give them your personal information.
RoguePOTUSStaff,The GOP wants to know, how is POTUS doing?

https://t.co/Cm7Xz6ubLP
RoguePOTUSStaff,@sharmila819 The only real limitation on what is "impeachable" is what can be sold to Senate and the public.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@sharmila819 Jaywalking is impeachable if Congress wants it to be. Impeachment is a political tool, that is why COTUS is so vague about it.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@justdreamin91 POTUS is driven by ego and power. He spends more to rip people off than it would cost to pay what they're owed.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@justdreamin91 Thus, nonpayment lawsuits + returns could demonstrate tax evasion.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@justdreamin91 But we have reason to susp returns + records could show deductions for expenses in form of "payments" that never got paid.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@justdreamin91 You're not understanding. Point is, do not expect to find ties you are hoping for. POTUS isn't really worried about that.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@justdreamin91 there is other info that directly contradicts them in a non-kosher way.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@justdreamin91 @jenyuen12 Okay. But tax returns, by themselves, are fairly irrelevant. Worth embarrassment at most. Unless, that is (cont)
RoguePOTUSStaff,@jenyuen12 @justdreamin91 POTUS real fear is that tax info could be compared against lawsuits to show evasion.

RoguePOTUSStaff,@patrici46970640 The debt fluctuates up &amp; down on a daily basis.  A $12B change can take place over a matter of hours as cash goes in &amp; out.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@WWIIFelger If facts are your idea of "vague and speculative" then you are in the wrong place.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@WWIIFelger Already reported? Silly person, anyone can check the daily debt figures from the treasury website.

RoguePOTUSStaff,@patrici46970640 https://t.co/UsqdkFH6H9
RoguePOTUSStaff,@sooatwoo You can check the math yourself if you'd like. Daily debt figures are published at https://t.co/UsqdkFH6H9
RoguePOTUSStaff,@WWIIFelger Do you need assistance finding the unfollow button?
RoguePOTUSStaff,@Hoof Exactly. Selectively touting trivial fluctuations is cherry picking data. A $12B difference in the debt is just one day at the office.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@WWIIFelger Congratulations??
RoguePOTUSStaff,@JenSMoss It's a focus on the trivial.  The debt fluctuates on a day to day basis. A $12 billion difference can happen in a matter of hours.
RoguePOTUSStaff,The media has also failed to report that from 2/8 to 2/15 this year, the debt increased by $53 billion. #incompetentPOTUS

RoguePOTUSStaff,The war on the media is only beginning. And it's going to get ugly. This needs to become an activism rallying point.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@smartmexguy That's what we were talking about.
RoguePOTUSStaff,Spicer really tries, but he just can't paint over the mud on the walls.
RoguePOTUSStaff,Recommendations for names that leakers should give to press for publication?
@cnn @msnbc @NBCNews @FoxNews @nytimes @NPR @politico @WSJ
RoguePOTUSStaff,@OneTuffCookee That would reek too much of 4chan.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@brienthess Perhaps he should have said " 'change your name' for ten minutes" for the irony impaired.
RoguePOTUSStaff,Everyone has a right under common law to change your name at will. Anon leakers should change their names for 10 mins when talking to press.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@justdreamin91 But above was just an example.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@justdreamin91 Oh, it was. Pence was the driving force that made it happen.

RoguePOTUSStaff,No, @POTUS , we won't put our names out. We know what you do to dissidents who put their names out.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@cwjones89 Actually we suggested a charity fundraiser b/c ppl were requesting merch, but nixed the idea when ppl raised some good points.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@JudiLariviere Leaks and failed background checks.
RoguePOTUSStaff,Remember that a "failed background check" just means that they don't trust you. Sometimes the reason was b/c they caught you leaking info.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@Manda_Colburn Leaks from high places usually involve chained messengers.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@gerrydel Actually he was just trolling. Watch the clip.
RoguePOTUSStaff,Despite yesterday's faux bromance, Bannon acting sheepish about FBI leak. May be the real source, trying to push Priebus out.
RoguePOTUSStaff,After a week of relative tame, POTUS foaming at the mouth @ FBI. Not sure what he's more angry about, the leak, or their refusal to obey.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@SArenschield Believe we did. Also brought it up again several days ago. We keep saying national security is the biggest issue.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@brayshizzle Distasteful.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@wits_mcgee Your willful ignorance is costing the lives of American troops. You are positively traitorous to your country.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@wits_mcgee the lives of our service men &amp; women that you can ignore facts right in front if you in print, to protect an incompetent POTUS.

RoguePOTUSStaff,@wits_mcgee And that justifies ignoring a military op in favour of tweeting? You sound line someone who hates our military men &amp; women.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@PrinceStrahd And we'll say it a million more times. Hate him for his politics all you want, but this is the stuff that matters most.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@darbunderscore "But why don't Rogue POTUS Staff ever tell us anything before news is covering it?"

RoguePOTUSStaff,@gingercsnapprod https://t.co/XvAjwgvToF
RoguePOTUSStaff,@deangelis28 Yes, but he does it more like a twisted cross between a Vulcan neck pinch and a chiropractic maneuver.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@Impeach_D_Trump Will sometimes grab ppl by shoulder, or lean on your shoulder, bearing weight down. Very creepy.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@Impeach_D_Trump Bannon has habit of grabbing and squeezing people to inflict mild pain, as a power tactic. Much like POTUS' handshake yank.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@gerrydel But it doesn't matter anyway, because we're not here to leak news. You should watch the news for that.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@gerrydel Or, you know, three days ago, if you look at the date stamp. Believe we even said it shortly after the mission, too.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@Moviocrity Sadly, we've recently become aware that some are trying to impersonate us for monetary reasons. Trying to sell books, etc.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@mr_grission If you're looking for leaks you should try news outlets. We don't provide leaks. You'd know that you'd followed &gt; 4 hours.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@mr_grission If you're just trying to tell ppl to follow another acct, hoping to sell a book by pretending to be us, then get lost.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@mr_grission We will not reveal our ID to anyone. ANYONE. End of story. If that's not good enough for you, then move on.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@mr_grission We are starting to suspect you are part of this recent trend of ppl trying to run spoof accts and turn around to sell our name.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@ShirleyAwana Then get phased. Get angry. We cannot let ourselves acquiesce and tolerate this level of willful incompetence.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@maddow Confirming this on tonight's episode. https://t.co/J46Dj92cyF

RoguePOTUSStaff,How is POTUS doing so far?

https://t.co/fSjZBySILf
RoguePOTUSStaff,@mr_grission Yeah. You have no idea what you're talking about. Sources are rarely secret, even when not published. We won't risk it.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@NicaWaters @kianfi13 Because the mailroom isn't even in the WH, for starters. They'll just be filtered into big bins and sent to warehouse.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@mr_grission @ljpne @workhardguy It's your funeral.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@workhardguy We kind of have this obsession with remaining anonymous.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@Juror_Fish You realize you are following *this* account, yes?
RoguePOTUSStaff,@albedoa Perhaps because you lack reading skills? They post vulgar riffs off of our tweets, nothing more.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@Juror_Fish If you checked the "joined" dates, and the website, all is evident.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@virgiltexas We are the true Rogue POTUS Staff. The other account is a vulgar imposter.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@Fems2Good4Trump Mostly just vents to Priebus and Pence.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@Allegratastic More like a lamentation that he has to parrot such idiotic stories.
RoguePOTUSStaff,Spicer was pointing out "bussing in paid protesters" claim makes no sense. Would be easier to send ppl to their own local meetings.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@nefertitirocks Pointing out POTUS claim makes no sense.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@jerseygirl85331 His point is that POTUS claim makes no sense.
RoguePOTUSStaff,Spicer on paid protesters: If they are coming from all over the country, TO all over the country, why not just send them to local meetings?
RoguePOTUSStaff,@StuTheLimey Look closer. They aren't spreading our "message." They are vulgar, juvenile trolls making us look poorly.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@Squirrel3218 There was a real disagreement. But it's been mischaracterized by media.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@stressandstars Not optics. Headaches.
RoguePOTUSStaff,DeVos doesn't care about transgender rights. She cares about fallout and being out in a difficult position.

RoguePOTUSStaff,@PinkSith Gee, maybe we should suggest a rally or a march, or something like that.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@moedawg Difference of thinking =/= trolling. If we can't engage in honest discourse with others, then we may as well delete this account.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@colormecultured All action must be public and conspicuous, unable to be brushed aside, and have substantive, actionable purpose.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@AlexanderEmmons Why do some people think that a simple metaphor must be turned into an exact duplication?
RoguePOTUSStaff,@Shantese631 Yes. Here you are, arguing for faux protesting instead of constructive production.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@Shantese631 Soothing yourself w/ self righteous zero impact is not "organizing." It is deluding yourself, and falling into Bannon's traps.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@PhilipRucker Article overstates the incident. DeVos was worried about the fallout, nothing more.

https://t.co/1teCUohiYn
RoguePOTUSStaff,@zhonne It's the kind of protests they hope happen. The kind that are quiet and easily ignored.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@zhonne The mailroom isn't even in WH. And all that will happen is that they'll all be filtered into trashcans. Good for nothing but laughs.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@MacIntyreStudio We hate to break it to people, but those post cards will never get through the door. Besides, it's silly slacktivism.

RoguePOTUSStaff,@Jidgettewynn What?
RoguePOTUSStaff,@ActivistTweeter Hit him on the inside and out.
RoguePOTUSStaff,Also worth considering, an Ides of March march, from Capitol to WH. Lobby the Senate to turn against the dictator.
RoguePOTUSStaff,If anyone organizes an impromptu FB event for Ides of March rally, we'll help put the word out. We can't do it, but feel free to run w/ it.
RoguePOTUSStaff,Are we the only ones who think the Ides of March would make a great date for a rally in front of WH demanding Flynngate independent council?
RoguePOTUSStaff,@mikd33 Congratulations, you've been duped.

RoguePOTUSStaff,@PainPumpkin Even worse. Were mostly regurgitating what we said until we blocked them.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@Kschmidt67 @RogueSNRadvisor True. But that wouldn't show as an addressee for each individual's message.

RoguePOTUSStaff,@RogueSNRadvisor Except there is no "all staff" grouping.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@Saythatforyou Stay skeptical, be logical, keep sight of the big picture and what matters most.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@Saythatforyou POTUS had no intention of firing Flynn. But Pence's leak was the checkmate that forced Flynn to resign and POTUS to accept.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@Saythatforyou KAC was on live TV 1 hour before resignation saying he wasn't going anywhere. Then the Yates leak went to WaPo. (cont)
RoguePOTUSStaff,@Saythatforyou What about Flynngate is so odd? Pence forced his resignation after info leak. It literally developed over just a few hours.

RoguePOTUSStaff,Before long this country is going to once again be subject to terrorist attacks b/c nobody is driving b/c POTUS is too busy tweeting.
RoguePOTUSStaff,Like it or not POTUS is the only one who has the legal auth and pwr for many decisions and actions. But he's ignoring because he's tweeting.
RoguePOTUSStaff,When the Yemen raid was happening, POTUS didn't even monitor the mission in the Sit. Room. Why? He was too busy tweeting.

RoguePOTUSStaff,@CaralynDavis Seeing as he's barely been in office long enough for your Q to even apply yet, that's a silly thing to ask.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@SaraNoHPurRayUh So, let people die so you can satisfy partisan desires? You know, just unfollow us. Goes for everyone who thinks the same.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@EmirSejdik If you think tweets will be impeach. evidence, then you're as delusional as POTUS. You want satisfaction over national security.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@HandsAtlanta Maximum opportunity to get Americans killed so that you can have the satisfaction of laughing at POTUS? How shallow.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@mark7five7 That's not the point. We need to force POTUS to go on record addressing his disregard for National Security duties.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@saeedi So, sacrifice national security so that you can have the pleasure of laughing at POTUS? Shame on you.
RoguePOTUSStaff,Petition is working.  10,000 signatures.  Let's get 10x more!

https://t.co/e9PE4wXU3r
RoguePOTUSStaff,@dredeyedick @AltFedEmployee That is actually a fake doc by an attention seeker.
RoguePOTUSStaff,It's not even enough to achieve end product POTUS wants. One must do it the way POTUS wants, even if it's dysfunctional. #selfsabotage
RoguePOTUSStaff,What does it mean to "support" POTUS agenda? Because even people who agree in principle but oppose tactics end up in the hot seat.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@Unite2020 Makes as much sense as a poor man "pretending" to be rich by donating millions to charity. The very idea is impossibly absurd.
RoguePOTUSStaff,RT @SwedeninUSA: We look forward to informing the US administration about Swedish immigration and integration policies. https://t.co/x5G3eu…
RoguePOTUSStaff,@LisaRomines1 If you are talking about @angryWHstaffer they are not real. As for ourselves, we won't gossip about marital matters.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@Knohoo1 On @MeetThePress this morning.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@evrsoelusv Your pup certainly helps your case. Shall we draw straws to choose whom of us gets the honor?
RoguePOTUSStaff,@someaustralian He's mixing up his lies. One set of lies to hide #UnholyTrinity plan from POTUS. Another set of lies for press about POTUS.
RoguePOTUSStaff,Priebus tipped his hand this morning. Asked about when he learned Flynn lied, he said Yates was fired for not doing her job. #wrongquestion
RoguePOTUSStaff,@Trump_Regrets This is true. We have found that if we don't make a point to try to laugh at something, we approach a sense of depression.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@nycjayjay https://t.co/j9rk4uzlY1
RoguePOTUSStaff,@ZWorld Already is.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@BytorNSnowdog At taxpayer expense. Govt will have to "buy out" the entire house. #profit
RoguePOTUSStaff,@melbert_splack Because LM is not credible journalist. Used her own search history (showing frequent use of "Nazi") to accuse someone else.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@PattyLuvsOliver We are multiple people here. As far as we can see, no other alleged WH rogues are real. One (CPI) is a Bannon led counter.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@phelpss6 Mensch also claims Zionists leaders are anti-Semites, and that @ProPublica are run by Bannon. Oh, and she works for Murdoch.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@UncouthMarie On, that guy. Even worse fake. When first created his profile even said it was parody. Later started claiming to be real.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@CaralynDavis Now you know what it feels like to be one of those people who believe in POTUS.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@CaralynDavis It's fake.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@MrVanHammersly No. That story was spread by a "journalist" who was angry because we wouldn't give her interview or ID ourselves to her.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@dumpsterboa False. We said Pence honestly did not know about Flynn's convos w/ ambassador. Not that he's "innocent."
RoguePOTUSStaff,@Nexykat They use Microsoft Word for drafts. And don't use faked headers like appear on that doc. @AngryWHStaffer is not real.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@dumpsterboa It's definitely not so that we can leave a calculated, false trail to thwart tracking efforts. Definitely not that.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@dumpsterboa Thanks for the warning. We'll take appropriate precautions.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@Nexykat Fake, and pathetically so at that. If it were real it would be on letterhead and bear a seal.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@dumpsterboa After everything we've done, you think posting a quote from a news show is where the risks are for us?
RoguePOTUSStaff,"The leaks, the fake news, the ANONYMOUS ACCUSATIONS..." --Priebus shout out to @RoguePOTUSStaff on @MeetThePress today. #wemakethemnervous
RoguePOTUSStaff,@Envelopedinblue That is the same kind of post hoc dogmatic that POTUS uses to whip his cult into a frenzy.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@MelissaJPeltier The point is that your accusation is proven 100% false. You should be ashamed for spewing unfounded falsities.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@MelissaJPeltier What happens to your theory when nothing happens?
RoguePOTUSStaff,POTUS isn't happy about thousands of people protesting against him, but we think it's great to see so many people resisting peacefully.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@DiogenesCritic Not to mention our code was gifted by a follower, whom we named when we first shared the site. There goes that theory.
RoguePOTUSStaff,Source code looks like the survey data not even collected, the only purpose of the page is to direct ppl to donatio… https://t.co/6wUz3MPP35
RoguePOTUSStaff,@LibbyBlog Next thing we knew, ppl were making a real rally out of it. Great! But then LM stomped on it. Hence why we're so disappointed.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@LibbyBlog Funny thing, it wasn't even our idea. We were about to retweet another alt account making the joke, but retweeted POTUS instead.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@SandaBlue https://t.co/rfHJh2BnMS
RoguePOTUSStaff,@BGHeaven we were to ever become harmful to the effort to encourage people being involved and engaged against POTUS.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@BGHeaven What we worry about is her dissuading resistance activities on premise that we encourage them. We will delete this acct if (cont)
RoguePOTUSStaff,@WeArePissedOff We think it matters if LM disinfo becomes damaging to the resistance movement just because we encourage activism.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@cinemaven Thank you for this.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@cinemaven #WomensMarch was a signature example of peacefully protesting. Every protest should aspire to be just like it.
RoguePOTUSStaff,We encourage skepticism. It's healthy. Believe or don't, whether we are who we say. But DO NOT suppress the movemen… https://t.co/yQhFLWgTt4
RoguePOTUSStaff,@PoliticalSteve2 Long story short: This admin has many separate internal influences that don't always mix.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@JonesCali1970 And if you think LM is credible you either don't know anything about her, or you're a fool. https://t.co/j7jDos4Ul5
RoguePOTUSStaff,@JonesCali1970 Louise Mensch is the one more likely to be a "Bannon tool." She is wreaking havoc on anti-POTUS demonstrations.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@Skyleer4444 Thanks for the support, but we're just trying to get a read on interest for the moment.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@Erin2323Erin Then unfollow. You want to complain on twitter but you won't take action? Someone here looks like POTUS, but it's not us.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@jonnyblackout Then unfollow. You want to complain on twitter but you won't take action? Someone here looks like POTUS, but it's not us.
RoguePOTUSStaff,Given POTUS' determination to spend every weekend in FL, who would attend a mid week rally in front of White House?
RoguePOTUSStaff,@ResistGaslite DC National Guard.
RoguePOTUSStaff,When POTUS doesn't seem to understand uranium. #finetunedmachine https://t.co/zb8RBczx8O
RoguePOTUSStaff,@_hunter_smith Don't bother, it's not even a real survey. It's just a ruse to get people to donate money.
RoguePOTUSStaff,Fox News Rant at Trump over Fake News https://t.co/9SZhJhdMXU
RoguePOTUSStaff,@sjklevinger Yeah, his actual quote was "fine" tuned machine. Nostra culpa.
RoguePOTUSStaff,On serious note, please retweet this to spread the message. #resist and #persist . https://t.co/S8i6oxtH07
RoguePOTUSStaff,When aides have to hide your cell to put you on twitter timeout because you make a fool of yourself things run like a  #finedtunedmachine .
RoguePOTUSStaff,When you assume a black woman is friends w/ the CBC because she's black and you're not racist, things are running like a #finetunedmachine.
RoguePOTUSStaff,When your PressSec accidentally calls the neighbor "Joe" because Canadian names are hard, you know you're running like a #welltunedmachine .
RoguePOTUSStaff,Unemployment is 4.6% but you feel like you've inherited a "mess" you know things are running like a #welltunedmachine .
RoguePOTUSStaff,When filling jobs by trading favors, and 6 staffers have to be fired in one day because they fail their background checks? #welltunedmachine
RoguePOTUSStaff,Let's make it trend.

That moment when your NatSec Advisor is forced to resign 24 days in because he's a Russian spy. #welltunedmachine
RoguePOTUSStaff,@RainyMyth We noticed. All because we suggested a protest against POTUS. Instead, she's suppressing anti-POTUS protesting. Such a shame.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@iamghostpope Sometimes they're from Antarctica.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@DValeyard You realize that's a lie started by Louise Mensch, in retaliation for not giving her an interview and our IDs, yes?
RoguePOTUSStaff,This is a finely tuned machine. And it's about how the White House is running. https://t.co/Bh1jiltFp2
RoguePOTUSStaff,@TheTank912 And by the end of the poll, they're more willing to donate, because they have a distressed feeling of "We have to do something!"
RoguePOTUSStaff,@TheTank912 Don't believe it's. Just a feeder. When you fill it out, it takes you to a donation page. Plant unwanted thoughts in minds(cont)
RoguePOTUSStaff,@thisea Fake. If it was a real WH memo it would be on letterhead, with a seal in the upper left.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@UNOFFICIAL17LA Maybe we're both.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@keewa Oh? https://t.co/qCxeSRn941
RoguePOTUSStaff,@TomPaineToday You're a little late to the party.
RoguePOTUSStaff,People wonder why we don't leak. RPS does not leak. But that doesn't mean that the people behind this account don't… https://t.co/jG3Dfezj6H
RoguePOTUSStaff,@LandoKardashian We are loquacious, and the volume of our tweets sometimes superfluous. Bannon wouldn't understand what that sentence means.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@keep_sanity You nailed it. We're a carefully planned, highly detailed conspiracy who happened to forget to consider who we're following.
RoguePOTUSStaff,POTUS says he "owned them" regarding press conference. However, was not amused afterward when someone pointed out Obama's 332 in 2012.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@Ms_JD Alleged whitehouseSNadvisor is a fake. Where's the official letterhead? Where's the seal? He often follows our tweets and restates.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@PeggyNewcomb4 Thank the Steves for those.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@blynken Spicer suggested to take Qs and many of them, to try repairing relationship with press, and for damage control over current issues.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@DistrictDave01 Spicer is Dir of Comm and PresSec. He advises POTUS how and what to communicate.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@sirclinksalot Nobody knows fake news like POTUS.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@CarolynZegeer There were too few Qs being offered, and many weren't to spec. POTUS made "in the moment" decision to go w/ Spicer's plan.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@Saru_Chan_ Power play / conveniently running out of time.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@iamghostpope Mensch is not a journalist, she's a conspiracy theorist.
RoguePOTUSStaff,Journalists know that if they tried a bait-and-switch they'd be blacklisted thereafter. https://t.co/7krHXVpAnV
RoguePOTUSStaff,@_Tara_Woods Sure. If you want to then be blacklisted.
RoguePOTUSStaff,At best, expect few Qs to be answered. Again, media may be reporting decision to take Qs not yet made, but reason is because of screening.
RoguePOTUSStaff,Press Conf as pushed back to 1230 to try screening more Qs before hand. But difficulty getting "acceptable" Qs now means that no Qs likely.
RoguePOTUSStaff,We believe that media has been informed that taking questions is "undecided" at this point. If you have access to TV suggest you watch now.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@mehosaurus Do a search for Louise Mensch and then ask that question again.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@jilliannicola Don't know and don't care? Critical thinking 101! Psst, she obliterated her credibility in UK so badly she had to flee to US.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@pikapp1977 The news should have announced it by now. Will be Acosta.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@hammijo She was all over breaking news about Theo Herzl being an anti-Semite, eh? And Liz Kendall's twitter history. And @Propublica , eh?
RoguePOTUSStaff,@jilliannicola If you believe someone like Mensch, then yes, please unfollow us.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@yogarph57 https://t.co/PBEC1oJdLA
RoguePOTUSStaff,@MelissaEJordan But we're not whistle blowers. Our goal is public action against incompetence. Mensch hurting that, suppressing opposition.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@cjpsmith Exactly! We encourage people to be skeptical. But the conspiracy theories are insane and hurt POTUS opposition. Occam's razor!
RoguePOTUSStaff,Select journalists being invited to have questions screened for use in press conference. Can enough be screened fast enough? Unknown.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@Dan_Gross Whole point is to outnum POTUS ally attendance &amp; fill w/ those opposed to him. Fracture ego and be ex how to #resistpeacefully
RoguePOTUSStaff,@IMakeMusicinNYC to have ties to POTUS ally Rupert Murdoch, to have history of backstabbing sources, and is now dissuading dissent of POTUS.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@IMakeMusicinNYC really it's quite telling that she accuses everyone of being Bannon disinformation, but she's the one who is known (cont)
RoguePOTUSStaff,@IMakeMusicinNYC the entire idea is built on a post hoc dogma, originating in LM's absurd claim that we are Bannon in disguise. And (cont)
RoguePOTUSStaff,@IMakeMusicinNYC (which wasn't even our idea in first place). That then made Mensch's drones reinterpret it as a Bannon plot. Thus, (cont)
RoguePOTUSStaff,@IMakeMusicinNYC a secret trap to get #resistance to turn violent is ONLY based on the fact that we retweeted the party crash idea (cont)
RoguePOTUSStaff,@IMakeMusicinNYC to POTUS to encourage violent protests in DC and then activate PresGuard. But the idea that this upcoming event is (cont)
RoguePOTUSStaff,@IMakeMusicinNYC Sure. We always tell people to #resistpeacefully . In fact, we were first to point out that Bannon has suggested (cont)
RoguePOTUSStaff,@pattonoswalt You're a funny man. Would think you'd know better than to fall for L Mensch nonsense. To each their own.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@Gregmogel Because Louise Mensch cooked up the claim in retribution for refusing to give her an interview and ID ourselves to her.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@JCLRRA If you are here to wage partisan battles then you're in the wrong place. We do this to oppose incompetence and delusion.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@licketysplitone He's following. We know. Don't know how he doesn't know that we know. https://t.co/cvAMXd6PX9
RoguePOTUSStaff,@trcekjure We need to disrupt Gorka's surveillance. He follows us, trying to figure us out. Looks over shoulders while watching our feed.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@ellexbean We really aren't sure. Most people around here have made peace w/ fact that half of things coming from him will make no sense.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@Mathieulh And we told you you're backing up the wrong tree.  So have a nice life.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@Mathieulh Do you follow us simply to troll like a 10 year old?
RoguePOTUSStaff,@tracetime No! Mercenary protesters are troublemakers looking to destroy things. #resistpeacefully No violence.
RoguePOTUSStaff,"because of all these leaks. It scares people. When it goes down again blame the leakers. It would be black Friday right now if not for me."
RoguePOTUSStaff,"The stock market loves me. It'll keep going up and up because Wall Street loves me. But watch, it's going to go down again (cont)
RoguePOTUSStaff,@JaneHull You don't exactly need to be a genius to work in this White House.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@Ian_F_Janssen We are.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@DouglasEich Google her. Ask her about Theo Herzl (father of modern Zionism) being an anti-Semite &amp; @propublica being run by Bannon.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@realDonaldTrump Truth shall set this country free. No matter how much you try to suppress it.
RoguePOTUSStaff,Threats and hostility abound as a renewed rampage against "leaks" forms. Meanwhile, POTUS bragging once again about stock market.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@dg33 So, calling him evil incarnate &amp; making jokes about him being a helpless drunk doesn't qualify as "bad"? Guess we have diff standards.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@MelissaJPeltier And you are clearly intent on suppressing any dissent of POTUS. How long have you been on his payroll?
RoguePOTUSStaff,@Mel_Ankoly Exactly. There have been tons of peaceful protests. For our part we have always told people to #resistpeacefully . Peace works.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@SmallSandi You cannot be serious. She believes @ProPublica is run by Bannon, Theodor Herz is an anti-Semite, and so on. But do as you like.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@heyitscena Louise Mensch and her associates. That is our point.
RoguePOTUSStaff,And this is the damage that Mensch causes. Suppressing resistance. Do not yield. #resist and #persist . But as alwa… https://t.co/zuqKduiwjW
RoguePOTUSStaff,@joinreclamation We answer to you? We've been encouraging people to #resist and #persist since the beginning. Don't like it, don't follow.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@LaurieOsborne20 We're not. But we don't want to see people being dissuaded to assemble and #resist off of pro-POTUS lies.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@TobyCat2017 Her and her drones are trying to shut down protests @ FL rally by claiming we are paying rabble rousers to start fights.
RoguePOTUSStaff,PSA: Heed not rumors from Louise Mensch about #resistancepartycrash , or anything, really. She's not all there.

https://t.co/yUU8vr9skn
RoguePOTUSStaff,@AmesCG Don't take it on faith. Take it with skepticism. More skepticism last November might have prevented POTUS winning.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@TheJays Just LM's normal twitter expertise.

https://t.co/cMBSr2Hg2n
RoguePOTUSStaff,@hazeinthepeg Pay no mind. @MelissaJPeltier is saying that because she is a Louise Mensch drone and is telling people WE are setting a trap.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@joinreclamation That Louise Mensch, she's a bizarre one.

https://t.co/SFaSxmi2SF
RoguePOTUSStaff,@joinreclamation 
https://t.co/mYF9WPrxpQ
RoguePOTUSStaff,@DTsSwampRats That rumor was cooked up by LM trolls (who claim we are secretly Bannon). We retweeted, so they think think it's a trap.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@Newguin If making a joke = fake in your mind, then you have our sympathies.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@NSASUCKSATTHIS Better luck next time.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@Liberty79128676 More of this Louise Mensch nonsense? What next? Bibi is an anti-Semite?
RoguePOTUSStaff,@mizenkay That's silly We're Russians who learned to speak English in the UK. And this never happened.
https://t.co/mYF9WPrxpQ
RoguePOTUSStaff,@Kelebration That is correct! But it is depressing, so apparently this is more appropriate for us to post.
RoguePOTUSStaff,For those who prefer that our tweets only be depressing, here's another image for you. https://t.co/pSNcsFdXU2
RoguePOTUSStaff,@JonJanke We definitely are not creative writers. But we need to laugh at least once a day or we'll go out of our minds.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@funnyasfarts Does everything we offer have to be couched in doom and gloom? Broaden your vision.
RoguePOTUSStaff,#ArtOfTheDeal https://t.co/Uut11sOqjf
RoguePOTUSStaff,@AltStateDpt @jasoninthehouse Oh, well that's easy. Pence was the one who directed the leaks that toppled Flynn. What now?
RoguePOTUSStaff,@chefmatt33 POTUS goes every weekend because they upped the prices I premise of POTUS attending regularly.
RoguePOTUSStaff,It would be a shame if #RESISTANCE crashed this rally. Don't do that. And definitely don't retweet this. https://t.co/hnlMAkPnJY
RoguePOTUSStaff,@MerriJensen @LuvYaBlue @lisaoren Hence most cabinet picks being people willing to swear fealty to POTUS.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@HughesSpeak Mostly oblivious. Ego blinds him. But loyalists like Bannon, Miller, etc whisper suspicions in his ear.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@AmesCG Context.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@Zyme_1 Yes. She can't understand the point. POTUS ignoring aides, denying reality. Puzder pulls himself out b/c POTUS can't pull trigger.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@msscommunicat That's good. Their job is to break news.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@Vibrantankles Puzder has a dozen Republicans against him.
RoguePOTUSStaff,Priebus now urging POTUS to move on from Puzder. Most now believe confirmation is unlikely.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@Avindair That's pretty good. We call it the power grab.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@lisaoren VP closing ranks inside WH, laying groundwork outside WH. Wants to be able to pull trigger in end game at moment's notice.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@lunaangelj Is that why we call Pence, Preibus, and Ryan the #UnholyTrinity ?
RoguePOTUSStaff,@KatMurawski Do you even know what we're talking about here?
RoguePOTUSStaff,@yogarph57 Pence did not know Flynn was lying to him. Trying to pretends to "connect dots" to say otherwise is delusional.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@yogarph57 To the contrary. Instead of connecting dots this emotional flooding, missing this point, and being detached from facts.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@annaleighcro Just because one person knows one thing does not mean all people know all things. You're letting hatred cloud your judgement.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@nmbenson2001 We work in the White House. We don't have info on hackers.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@JCLRRA Really? Clinton's campaign knew what was said on a phone call in December? You're meeting passions carry you away. Stay focused.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@heaven4life69 Well, Pence did trigger the leaks that led to Flynn resignation. That's something.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@draculasspatula That is the exact opposite of what we said.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@Botanicalsrock That's a leaf in a forest. Go bigger picture.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@SukiSMiller @Teacher_Toni Behind all what?
RoguePOTUSStaff,@MAMike4 That's been #UnholyTrinity end game since day one.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@JCLRRA VP legitimately did not know until Thursday. Had info leaked in retaliation to push Flynn out.
RoguePOTUSStaff,POTUS knew Flynn was lying, but assured VP he was telling truth.
RoguePOTUSStaff,Flynn lied to VP, but he's not the only one. Pence has been angry at POTUS too.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@PurlLeslie @scubafanatic And?
RoguePOTUSStaff,And don't expect POTUS to try his handshake shenanigans with Israeli PM.
RoguePOTUSStaff,Kushner eager about Netenyahu meeting, and POTUS sends to think he can pull BN's strings. Feels more like business meeting than diplomacy.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@LacySch06796228 POTUS travels every weekend.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@GretchenAPeck Entirely false. POTUS has no part. Even tried to refuse resignation at first.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@GretchenAPeck Pence compared it to seppuku and demanded that Flynn prove his loyalty to America by protecting administration.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@GretchenAPeck That was directed at Pence et al, who pressured Flynn resign by insisting that someone has to go and that he was someone.
RoguePOTUSStaff,POTUS has that bulging forehead vein thing going on. Something has hit a nerve.  Should there be a rally in front of the White House soon?
RoguePOTUSStaff,@bjatmcw POTUS is unaware.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@DarrenOKeefe1 Not alone, but he was the driving force. Priebus assisted.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@yourltldogtoo Still don't think he's thought through running for President.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@cybermeez Says he wants to go after them for defamation, and bury them in costs. Doesn't care about winning. Says it will send a message.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@avitable All the time. But he doesn't listen.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@scubafanatic Pence secretly had enough info leaked to media to back Flynn in corner. Then confronted him Flynn to demand resignation.
RoguePOTUSStaff,POTUS finally dropped the C word toward leakers in WH.  Wants to "sue their pants off" in court.
RoguePOTUSStaff,POTUS is annoyed with Kellyanne. Says she keeps "messing up." Upset that her spin clashes with the now official spin created by Pence.
RoguePOTUSStaff,POTUS seeing Pence is more loyal than ever, after having come up with spin strategy. Rejects Bannon's claims, at least on surface.
RoguePOTUSStaff,Bannon and Miller seem in agreement about Pence being behind Flynn's ouster, but only Bannon has said as much to POTUS so far.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@JaceLGalloway He most certainly is. He, and he alone, commands our nuclear arsenal. Take him very, very seriously.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@General_Discord Honestly? Best bet is probably the lawsuits.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@kiptonia You don't understand. Pence and Priebus are the ones keeping POTUS in check.
RoguePOTUSStaff,VP &amp; COS hoping to insert another establishment player if COS replacement is needed. But not sure they can.
RoguePOTUSStaff,If Priebus goes then Pence stand alone. POTUS loyalists lost the Flynn battle, but may be winning the war.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@EponymousGinger This White House is not as united as you think. Multiple opposing teams are at work.
RoguePOTUSStaff,POTUS hates his strings being pulled. But right now he seems to feel more like Pinocchio than a real President.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@ibrake4ants @rosieogrady53 Not surprised now, surprised when he learned about it.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@juliewarren5713 DC politics 101: Best way to defend a lie is to repeat it.
RoguePOTUSStaff,Only one thing changed over the course of Monday: publicity. Flynn wasn't fired, Pence forced him to resign. https://t.co/OOZDM8YJQL
RoguePOTUSStaff,@EpiphaniesToo Ryan defends the party.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@Dong_Piece Be cynical. We need more cynicism nowadays.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@rosieogrady53 VP was sincerely surprised. Has been gunning for Flynn since the news broke. VP realizing defending Loyalists dangerous.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@TracyMacNish It indicates that he is ambitious. Eventually tossing out POTUS has been #UnholyTrinity end game from day one.
RoguePOTUSStaff,POTUS once again feeling like he's being sabotaged from within. He's not wrong, but his his reasoning is completely off the mark.
RoguePOTUSStaff,The Yates news was the straw that broke Flynn, and also used to force POTUS to accept resg. Now POTUS angrier than ever about leaks.
RoguePOTUSStaff,Ryan's statement false. POTUS was bypassed. Pence made resignation happen.
RoguePOTUSStaff,More often than not the story is office politics, not public politics.
RoguePOTUSStaff,The good news for POTUS is that accepting Flynn's sudden resg gave him leverage to negotiate the return of his phone. Such a deal maker.
RoguePOTUSStaff,Pence and Preibus have scored a victory. But will it be enough to save Preibus? The W may be short lived.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@MuscleSpiritz Pence happened.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@Jeff_Rosie You're not wrong. Sometimes the reporter leaks info to the source. Sometimes by accident, sometimes not.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@RachelWBarchie If we didn't respond to skeptics then you wouldn't get an A to your Q. ;) Read the feed. We've answered your Q many times.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@TCStrollerMoms Yes, but not for the reasons they think we're responding.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@Mathieulh Problem is, you're barking up the wrong tree.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@Mathieulh Now, if you're done with moving the goal posts you should go watch the news.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@Mathieulh Yes, with potatoes. The fact that you even have to ask demonstrates you're way out of your league.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@Mathieulh If you think they have our ID then you're clearly operating 10 levels below.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@FanSince09 Actually she's a journalist. Goes to show why we won't trust media. They can be worse than politicians.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@Mathieulh You're saying the FBI want to impersonate us, but we're the ones who can't be taken seriously? Okay then. Good luck.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@_anahbeth @AltStateDpt Because he's on a Twitter time out.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@RealEnzoLoren It doesn't take testifying in court for a source to be known.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@kathy_lemaire That's brilliant. Nobody else had thought about that before. That subject has definitely never come up around here before.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@Benita_Lee Well, if you believe the low level journalists who are spamming us tonight, it means that KAC is fake.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@e3kmouse You really should learn to abstract your thinking.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@EoinHiggins_ @libbycwatson If you have to ask then you shouldn't be following.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@TSCLGC @americana__SAD @NatEnquirer Then unfollow.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@libbycwatson You've just marked yourself as one of two people by breaking the news. Get it now?
RoguePOTUSStaff,@libbycwatson Imagine you were in our shoes. A piece of info known only to two people is given to you by POTUS. You break the news. (cont)
RoguePOTUSStaff,@TimFaulkner_81 That is a complex question. What we can say at the moment is that many things have developed quickly here today.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@americana__SAD We don't break news.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@reva702 TBH, the knives have been out since November.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@JAStruck85 Not really. We're not a news outlet. Maybe you got lost looking for CNN.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@oscarmcpheee We mean after enough time has passed that demonstrating knowledge can't imply our IDs.
RoguePOTUSStaff,We cannot offer much context on Flynn resig at moment.  Probably tomorrow afternoon before info channels become adequately anonymous.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@sisk @shellawish Not credible. We are Russian British Scandinavian Frenchmen who work for Steve Bannon. Or so we're told.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@SuzieThompson57 Because "get some guts" is polite society where you cine from? All we did was point out a fact.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@SuzieThompson57 We just told nearly 780k people.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@TheDogberry Because the best was to comment on media reporting is to content before the reporting happens. Think you need physics lessons.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@Nelle451Nelle Have a nice life.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@kaila0965 It means POTUS has a massive ego and fires people who prove things he wishes were false.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@vikleigh If you have to ask then you should just unfollow. You're obviously looking for the wrong things in the wrong place.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@jenniowens82 Executive us like any other job. Bosses can decide to fire you for BS one day, then wait for excuse to conceal real motives.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@MitchMcConell It was the excuse.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@Nelle451Nelle By "media" we meant media.
RoguePOTUSStaff,Media finally learned Yates raised flags re: Flynn before being fired. What they're still not seeing is that it's the reason she was fired.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@SharonK470 Funny how some people think they're geniuses for over complicating simple things.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@JoannaMokhtari Yez, we no. But miss steaks like that help prevent language prophiling. We do'nt spell like dat at the offise.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@RealEnzoLoren @CliveBGordon Besides, we're not here to leak news. If you don't like that, then unfollow. well help you if you'd like.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@RealEnzoLoren @CliveBGordon ID of people who leak to journalists aren't well kept secrets. IRL it doesn't work like in the movies.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@reenale This past weekend, actually.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@BelPatty This is not the first time.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@DangerMouse917 @WickedKat42 That's not him. He has it taken away again this past weekend.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@WickedKat42 9:45 tonight.
RoguePOTUSStaff,Latest office betting pool speculates on how long before POTUS has withdrawal seizures due to being put on twitter timeout.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@katiedlm In some instances, we come across info through, shall we say, risky measures. We have various resources &amp; tactics at our disposal
RoguePOTUSStaff,@katiedlm we here through office grapevine, etc. All cases we only post after sufficient time that showing specific knowledge cannot ID us.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@katiedlm We will acknowledge that quote we used may not be 100% verbatim. Suffice it to say some things we here direct, other times (cont)
RoguePOTUSStaff,@RazorSharpShade No, that's not what we said at all.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@miadolphins117 Don't worry, we're 10 steps ahead.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@AmandaPanda0819 Tried to. Trudeau shut it down.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@katiedlm Oh yay. More armchair linguistics. Next tell us about how we use British grammar, not American grammar.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@katiedlm You are the one saying it was in English. Recheck. Your. Assumptions.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@Mathieulh Barking up the wrong tree.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@katiedlm Again, recheck assumptions. Pols often very different in pvt than what you see in public. We're used to that, but most ppl aren't.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@Shane_Conneely Are you sure?
RoguePOTUSStaff,@katiedlm Recheck your assumptions.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@CLManussier @poochitz True. But many people don't realize that most pols are very different ppl when out of spotlight. Not a just US thing.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@poochitz Wouldn't exactly call him "unguarded." We had to go out of our way to do some eavesdropping. We were a bit surprised at tone, too.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@Sensata2014 We're not allowed to talk about it, for obvious reasons.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@didntthathurt It's okay, we're on the unlimited twitter plan.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@katiedlm Comments were in between themselves. But the trashcans have ears around here sometimes.
RoguePOTUSStaff,"...And now he thinks it's because they all were scared of him. But the whole time they were just laughing at him."
RoguePOTUSStaff,PM Tru likens POTUS to "that one kid who never got beaten up only because everyone else thought he was too pathetic to be worth it. (cont)
RoguePOTUSStaff,Trudeau overheard expressing offense to his cabinet members @ POTUS handshake games. Finds is "disrespectful and tasteless."
RoguePOTUSStaff,"This guy is an idiot. He has no idea what he's doing." Overheard by Trudeau to Freeland.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@BlandyFisher Since day one. Problem is not getting people to talk about, problem is getting POTUS to listen.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@GaryPilts Okay, then consider this. We have many "celebs" follow us, and have been cited by Fox News and other sources. Both cannot be real
RoguePOTUSStaff,@GaryPilts CNN cited them because they reach out to media outlets trying to up the facade. We don't speak to media b/c it's too dangerous.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@GaryPilts Third, freq pretend to post "just now" type photos to imply veracity, always later shown to be created by assorted reporters.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@GaryPilts Second, they don't ever claim veracity themselves. Declare themselves "propaganda" and leave the troll accts to claim veracity.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@GaryPilts They seem to be tiring of that tactic, but many Bannon staff have been making mass fakes and spamming our tweets as such.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@GaryPilts For starters, steady stream of fake accounts that continue to be made just to follow us, cry foul, and tell people to follow CPI.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@rocketbootkid The Canadian equivalent is RCAF 001.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@Cozy1950 Pay no attention to the propagandist.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@Amniot Have to make a point to laugh at least once a day. Otherwise, we'd have lost our marbles already.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@TrumpanZ IE @ rogueCPI, an account run by Bannon's office attempting to discredit us b/c they can't figure out how to silence us.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@YmmyMmmy In all honesty, POTUS marital speculation is the fodder of tabloid rags. Nobody in WH really cares either way.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@MelissaakaMom But the emails....
RoguePOTUSStaff,@CAndayaWallace Well, one out of three ain't bad. Anyway, POTUS has a private phone. That is know. Further comment = NatSec violation.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@firePOTUS Skip over what you don't like.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@LoriScintillaa Follow the money.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@industrialest8 To think, we questioned our own tech aptitude at first.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@jpflach The "inner circle" is mostly divided into two camps that don't mix well: There is the Establishment camp &amp; also the Loyalist camp.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@john_aulabaugh It's pretty easy. As long as we don't tell them we're doing it, or do it in sight of them, they don't know.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@pawlietv If you invoke logic you must use it. We are using this to verify this account has not been hijacked away… https://t.co/lTtA6piWGp
RoguePOTUSStaff,@Makeawish3 Hence why it is useful to have an external/unconnected method for us to share such info. For ex: through a website we control.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@n_e_azil The good news is that you are an expert at maintaining perspective and maintaining big picture vision.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@ableix Wow, thanks! We hadn't even thought of that!
RoguePOTUSStaff,@stonedindenver We can't be helped if you can't master the internets.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@spudowiar @Joshua_Brindle While it may be true that POTUS does not get much work done, don't you think pple have better things to do?
RoguePOTUSStaff,@jasonvincent00 https://t.co/sC8HtUKdIc
RoguePOTUSStaff,@Joshua_Brindle So your hypoth is that an inj would be gotten in prep, then acct hacked away, then we'd just comply w/ the ct order?
RoguePOTUSStaff,@asknbid @skim Thank you for your concern, but it is entirely on the wrong playing field.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@MissyGreenbean Our point is that if someone somehow seized control of this account, we would report it on the website.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@EmperorRump Said another way: If someone is trying to run you over w/ a car, don't waste your time by complaining that they're speeding.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@Mortu4 Jan 31st.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@gmoyer17 Oh, let us tell you all about it.  Everyone looking for us, cover your eyes....
RoguePOTUSStaff,@TheHobbitHub Actually, step one is to be so anonymous a subpoena is irrelevant.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@MissyGreenbean Tell you what...if you can change the content of the website within next 24 hours, we'll tell you our real names. Good luck.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@TheHobbitHub No offense, but you're Q is on a level so rudimentary in comparison to our security methods it's irrelevant.
RoguePOTUSStaff,This URL address will provide external verification if there is ever a concern for the security of this account.

https://t.co/rfHJh2jMVk
RoguePOTUSStaff,We are contemplating stowing away on RCAF 001. We hear they're cool with refugees.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@phoEbe2theMOON Check the date.
RoguePOTUSStaff,POTUS looking forward to getting back at Trudeau for Twitter trolling RE refugees.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@LilianHarvey Correct.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@Patriot_212 Focus on what matters.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@LoriScintillaa As long as the public is distracted by things like the sanctions convo and other small potatoes.
RoguePOTUSStaff,Sanction talk is missing the big picture. Flynn tapped for a reason. Boot him, POTUS will just replace w/ another conduit to Putin.
RoguePOTUSStaff,Regarding Flynn, he's not going anywhere. Pence/Priebus camps may hate him by now, but POTUS is committed. And they think they know why.

RoguePOTUSStaff,The print “captures the essence of Donald Trump's campaign.” And of our lives inside his White House.

Russia propaganda turns up in US foreign policy query https://t.co/Y23nFbcu9i
RoguePOTUSStaff,@kdqd3 Not exactly sure what you're asking, but we can tell you that we get hundreds of comments an hour. only even see &lt; 1% if them.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@coronadoconcep1 We've always responded to people, both wise and foolish.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@coronadoconcep1 You're right. We confess. This is Donald Trump tweeting from RPS acct. Guessed their p/w. RPS has been locked up in Gitmo.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@coronadoconcep1 @anaisleciel Goal post moving kettle logic.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@t1l2b3 @coronadoconcep1 @anaisleciel Look at profile. If we ever lost control of this acct we would announce on the website. #contingencies
RoguePOTUSStaff,@coronadoconcep1 @anaisleciel Except, we do. You know we made a website, right?
RoguePOTUSStaff,@coronadoconcep1 Wow. Nobody said anything about anyone being a slave. Now you're just making up nonsense. Talk about alternative facts.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@JenniferLPryor Even if someone hijacked this acct, that wouldn't give them access to the website we've created.

RoguePOTUSStaff,@kim_nead Security measures. All we will say.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@mclanea Problem is incompetence implementation.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@theslylibrarian Whomever tells him what he most want to hear.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@WakeLakeAustin @mmitchell_ai Actually it's an unsecured android owned by an insecure POTUS.
RoguePOTUSStaff,This is what incompetence looks like. This is why we must #resist and #persist

https://t.co/t2eLFOhqoy via @Verge
RoguePOTUSStaff,@mmitchell_ai To be fair, we have an advantage by posting from Moscow, which is several hours ahead of D.C.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@MisterChase True statements are not attacks.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@MisterChase Apparently you've mistaken us with the New York Times.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@prisrob https://t.co/LMTbFVjLuW
RoguePOTUSStaff,@Joyce88072204 Not at all. It's perfectly normal for a POTUS to throw things across the room when he doesn't get his way, then blame others.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@Rawlins1Theresa Absolutely. Cory successfully IDed us and gave control of account to Ivanka. So they fired him. #startmakingsensepeople
RoguePOTUSStaff,@native_amaris We really should send him an apology letter.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@Ldydewood have also been created to tell people that we've been "compromised." Many urging to follow CPI instead.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@Ldydewood Since they've failed to ID us, Bannon has launched an effort to discredit us. RogueCPI is part of it. Many troll accts (cont)
RoguePOTUSStaff,@Boredofwheels It's a "strategy" to exert more control over press and exercise message control. And it may become the norm for this admin.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@Eshlam We're concerned about what we might be inspiring. You're right, we shouldn't be like him. But we worry that we accidentally are.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@MythIsMinotaur Spicer doing that job permanently, and replacing him as PressSec.

RoguePOTUSStaff,@coronadoconcep1 We sorry. We be talkin dumb from now on. Don't want no misunderstandings. Happy you being now?
RoguePOTUSStaff,@coronadoconcep1 Seriously? That's your argument? You doubt because we speak too intelligently? That's worse than the Cyrillic argument.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@NormaLouise @GreySkyLady @SuzyEvans11 That is a question better asked to tabloids.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@connor_medcalf Where did we ever say we're here to leak news?
RoguePOTUSStaff,@eliseambrose POTUS cares about effectiveness of the tactic. Wants to find way to have more control of interviews and their appearance.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@KrisRomani Neither. It was an event.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@RoseBetit If we did that, who would pull back the curtain in what's happening on the inside?
RoguePOTUSStaff,@grammaticats @m_augustine9  Yes, we actually already knew. :-D Q is, set up by whom? Suspect it's part of Bannon's CPI operation.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@BrandiDevlin Most papers are for show. POTUS liked to create the appearance of being constantly busy.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@m_augustine9 Believe what you rant. Need assistance unfollowing?
RoguePOTUSStaff,@m_augustine9 would be point? If Bosses got control of account they weeks delete it, not impersonate us.

RoguePOTUSStaff,@PresidentChrist Now it's your turn. Where did you receive your degree in forensic linguistics?
RoguePOTUSStaff,@PresidentChrist Oh sure! Names are Sally, Jamal, Henry, and Veronica.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@kdqd3 @m_augustine9 You need to reevaluate ur priorities. Opps, did we say "ur"? Oops, did we say "opps"?
RoguePOTUSStaff,@m_augustine9 Understand what?
RoguePOTUSStaff,@DrewStender ;) Varied voices minimize ability of anyone watching and trying to ID us to develop a profile.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@m_augustine9 No, it's not the first we've mentioned it. But believe you're own lies if you want. We see that a lot nowadays.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@ThePolyLife So "addicted" to followers we keep telling people to stop following? We get enough of such nonsense @ work. Don't need it here.

RoguePOTUSStaff,@SuzyEvans11 Starting to question the mental health of all in WH, including ourselves. Especially ourselves. Always have to be paranoid.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@aburak No doubt many will attribute that to time difference between DC and Moscow.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@Danny_Cavanagh @klynnelaraway we are diverse.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@doglogic777 About 100 ans prepared in adv. Most appropriate answer fed, based on question. Designed so they could be cascaded together.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@antibloviator Mostly he's a petty, elitist sycophant.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@klynnelaraway Better than being face to face w/ him and seeing his eyes dart up and down.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@SkinsATL Approx 100 carefully crafted responses prepared ahead of time. Most appropriate answer fed, based on question.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@Native_Wash Series of carefully crafted responses were prepared ahead of time. Most appropriate response was fed, based on question.
RoguePOTUSStaff,Teleprompter interview. POTUS was happy with Miller's teleprompter interview on MTP.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@MarilynRMarks1 Teleprompter.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@allicatFL No idea how correct you are. POTUS is the embodiment if gaudy.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@Im_watching_now On MTP an hour ago, yes. He was reading from teleprompter. POTUS liked that Todd was "controlled" by loquacious statements.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@KrisRomani if that's how you feel then unfollow. You are imagining whatever you want to see if something is "not right" about this comment.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@MAMike4 Spicer has been doing both jobs. Plan was to find petmanent Comm. Director, but POTUS leaning toward going opposite direction.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@mapchgo That's just how he looks. But yes, he was reading from teleprompter.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@HokieJAC He was.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@MAMike4 Expect Spicer to be replaced as PressSec and become permanent communications director.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@deangelis28 POTUS is happy about the tactic. Thinks it is more effective at controlling the message.
RoguePOTUSStaff,POTUS happy with Miller's telephone interview. Contemplating making it required practice.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@kyleethedingo If you are diagnosed w/cancer do you say "not my cancer"? Sites accepting the fact mean you respect your cancer?
RoguePOTUSStaff,@silas_snief Resistance is not futile. But not all methods are effective. We must all be willing to abandon ineffective methods.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@seyswho It's not for him.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@kyleethedingo But really they are just indulging themselves to shut out reality. Denial is a classic form of avoidance coping.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@kyleethedingo If we can't accept those facts, then we risk our destruction to enjoy a blissful ignorance.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@kyleethedingo Like it or not, POTUS commands our nukes. He is the only person w/ authorization to commands military to stop an attack.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@kyleethedingo He IS POTUS. Fact. Denying it is living in the world of alt facts. Accepting facts doesn't mean liking them.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@dlanoDlaeR aren't acceptable, and denying POTUS is POTUS is appeal to alt facts. This isn't funny nor a game. We must take him seriously.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@dlanoDlaeR POTUS is POTUS. We must accept that b/c it's true. He is in command of our nukes. We can't marginalize that. Alt facts (cont)
RoguePOTUSStaff,@kyleethedingo But we don't abide absurdities or mindless passions when that's what's wrong with POTUS in the first place.

RoguePOTUSStaff,@studentactivism You sound like an angry little man, lashing out just for the fun of it. You remind us of our boss.

RoguePOTUSStaff,@yeahtakethat of that answer is to keep doing what we are doing. But we seem to be doubling the problem, not reducing it.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@yeahtakethat For us, we find it disheartening to be caught between same ugliness on both sides. Adobe all why we don't resign. Part (cont)
RoguePOTUSStaff,@Perry_T Following orders. POTUS didn't like the image that admin had done something wrong. Said Spicer should have denied it was an issue.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@swettpantsmoney Our concern is that we seem to be encouraging the same kind of ugliness we oppose in POTUS, just from other side of aisle.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@LindsideOut Odd. She attacked us out if the blue. But you are mad we responded? Such pointless hostility. So petty.
RoguePOTUSStaff,Doubting the value of what we're doing. Most seem more interested in petty indulgence than substantive engagement. No better than POTUS.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@studentactivism And you too sound like POTUS. So very classy.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@MiniGuinea Engage in esp. to satisfy your petty desires? You may as well unfollow now. We won't betray our country just b/c you hate POTUS.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@AngryBlackLady You sounds like POTUS.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@_NaDene_ Denial will not accomplish anything, except to reduce your urgency.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@BriannaFraizer Dr. King would disagree with you.

RoguePOTUSStaff,@MurMyrrhTweet win that game. He will beat us with experience. Go high. Fight on substance. He doesn't know how to deal with substance.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@MurMyrrhTweet We must attack with substance. Reducing to empty style means we are playing his game w/ his rules. And he will always (cont)
RoguePOTUSStaff,@JPTBus So what are you going to do about it? Too many people are satisfied to call him names, then call it a day. That's how POTUS does it.

RoguePOTUSStaff,@zenstitcher And if he controls his allies AND his enemies, then he believes he controls the entire world.

RoguePOTUSStaff,@OhmsParty Everything. It's considered unprosecutable. It could never actually be proven in a court of law.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@agincourtrays1 We meant generally.
RoguePOTUSStaff,Flynn sanctions talk is being treated as fortunate smokescreen. Nothing will come of it, but it will keep attention away from hotter issues.
RoguePOTUSStaff,Even after fuming at KC for "buy Ivanka" line, POTUS also mad at Spicer for "counseled" line b/c it implies that admin did something wrong.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@blackmarks To the contrary. It goes straight to his head. Every last drop.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@Humanitarian66 Seeing a janitor have their job threatened because they can't remove drink stain from POTUS throwing cup is a scary thing.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@Humanitarian66 And many are concerned about others, even if they aren't directly suffering. It is ugly, vicious, and dangerous in here.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@Humanitarian66 Your mistake is to assume we're talking about "low level" staff. The hostile environment is effecting all levels.
RoguePOTUSStaff,POTUS smitten with Japan PM. Says "we need people like this guy around here" regarding PM's complimentary disposition toward POTUS.
RoguePOTUSStaff,Pence &amp; Priebus hope to enlist AG to advise POTUS to rescind immigration EO and issue new order. But AG hesitant, knows POTUS is stubborn.
RoguePOTUSStaff,POTUS irritated that sev. members of Patriots team will not attend WH visit. Saying he will lobby owner to cut them from the team.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@mspennisue We're actually more concerned with the intentional false trail we are leaving in the process of such replies.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@JoeShmoe1984 We meant that we don't deserve to be seen in the same light as him. Our service men and women stand apart for what they do.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@HonestPresDJT They even posted it before @jeneps did, and she is the person who took the picture.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@HonestPresDJT They posted it in the middle of the game, just moments after it was taken, before it was published anywhere.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@HonestPresDJT @PatOBrienPhoto Which shows our point. Posting it would easily identify them, and they would know that, if they were legit.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@HonestPresDJT @PatOBrienPhoto How many reporters are handing out their pics on site to everyone and anyone who wants them? None. (cont)
RoguePOTUSStaff,@HonestPresDJT @PatOBrienPhoto Pic was taken by reporter, but CPI posted in middle of SB. Was given to them on on site by reporter (cont)
RoguePOTUSStaff,@prisoner4364539 That was uncalled for.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@PatOBrienPhoto If they were "legit" that photo would instantly identify them. That pic is the smoking gun. They are an "approved leak."
RoguePOTUSStaff,@PatOBrienPhoto Did you see their pic of POTUS in FL? A staffer doesn't stand that close to and snap pics without being unnoticed. (cont)
RoguePOTUSStaff,@JoeShmoe1984 No, your son is the hero.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@Sheila_MacVicar Then do not follow. Let us know if you need assistance finding the correct button.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@K_Freudenberger No, we tweeted a pinterest photo to show that the request for inside photography was pointless.
RoguePOTUSStaff,Morale throughout is beyond desperate. Some are suggesting handing out literature about looking for signs of suicidal ideation in others.
RoguePOTUSStaff,Spicer is already burning out. Been carrying double load, but greatest stressor is having to paint over obvious lies and absurdities.
RoguePOTUSStaff,POTUS set on taking EO case to SCOTUS now, despite all advice that doing so would weaken the case. Cares more about winning than succeeding.
RoguePOTUSStaff,POTUS encouraged Kellyanne to push Ivanka clothing in interview, but later said she'd be fired if she makes another mistake like that.
RoguePOTUSStaff,POTUS going fully rabid. Causing chaos, then blaming everyone else when things go badly. Demands omelettes, then fires whom cracks the eggs.

RoguePOTUSStaff,POTUS has ordered Spicer to say meeting will be rescheduled even though POTUS has no interest in doing so.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@Caitlin805 Asked to resign, given ultimatum, tomato, tomato. Kennedy refused to buy in, so now POTUS says he's a traitor.
RoguePOTUSStaff,Real concern starting to emerge that POTUS not even acting as he believes best, just for spite. Ex: gutting EU data law because Obama.
RoguePOTUSStaff,When well intended patriots disagree, that's democracy. When POTUS says it's not fact until he approves it, that's tyranny.
RoguePOTUSStaff,@dmarie999 @RogueNASA The sad part is hearing POTUS say "Ppl don't need facts, they just need info. Control the info and you control them."
RoguePOTUSStaff,POTUS undeterred on hiring freeze in light of exodus of govt employees. Says Depts must "get the job done it you're fired." #celebrityPOTUS
RoguePOTUSStaff,@CassieFambro Discretion is key. We're taking all precautions.
RoguePOTUSStaff,Under Secy Kennedy is a traitor for resigning, according to POTUS. Kennedy departs over POTUS plans for a "torture first" foreign policy.

RoguePOTUSStaff,Everyone in the room knew POTUS was lying about 5 million illegals voting, but nobody dared to point it out. What have we done?
RoguePOTUSStaff,POTUS loved Kellyanne's alternative facts line. Said she was dumb for it, but loved the idea anyway because people would talk about it.
RoguePOTUSStaff,Nobody's really sure who's in charge. POTUS is easily manipulated with smooth compliments. Spkr. Ryan is pulling some strings.
RoguePOTUSStaff,Pres. Trump doesn't quite understand the difference between being POTUS and being a business owner. Keeps asking "who says I can't?"
RoguePOTUSStaff,@RogueNASA You have friends in the White House.  Just remember that.
RoguePOTUSStaff,Pres. Trump is already making waves at the office.  Wants to be "the President who will be remembered as a King." His words, not ours.

alt_fda,@alt_fda What this really comes down to is making sure that the test equipment, test &amp; lab personnel  are capable of doing the test.
alt_fda,@alt_fda The FDA has not been pushing this as it's non-production diagnostics &amp; may create burdensome oversight.
alt_fda,@alt_fda Legislation like this has been proposed for years now in one form or another. The last push was during the compounding scandal.

alt_fda,@Jillbles Not arguing use of biomarkers in therapy, that is their best use. I'm pointing out that they cannot b the only method 4 approval.
alt_fda,@Jillbles bio markers do allow targeted therapy &amp; r used like that now. It's when it's the only requirement that I'm stating.
alt_fda,@alt_fda Joe is arguing that he would like corps 2 b able 2 selectively decide that cocaine is once again good 4 tooth aches.
alt_fda,@alt_fda The FDA incorporates all these methods together into current trials 2 get the full picture of a drug &amp; its interactions.
alt_fda,@alt_fda These examples r on the extreme side but represent how each method was done in the past.
alt_fda,@alt_fda It does not address the migraines u have while on it. The long term study shows no liver damage &amp; drug X is approved.
alt_fda,@alt_fda Let's go back to method 1. It's in a long term study. The study is only looking at if drug X damages ur liver, it's target organ.
alt_fda,@alt_fda 4th- long term. This one would seem the best but it greatly depends on the study.
alt_fda,@alt_fda That however is not required in this method of approval. If drug X slows or stops ur cancer &amp; most don't die, it works.
alt_fda,@alt_fda As many ppl died from the chemo as they did from cancer then. It took concurrent &amp; post outcome studies to pull this data out.
alt_fda,@alt_fda Before long term studies of chemo treatments were undertaken, no 1 knew how much, when or what the limits were.
alt_fda,@alt_fda 3rd method- disease modification and modulation. Cancer treatments R an excellent example of this.
alt_fda,@alt_fda Drug X is still approved due to it being effective overall &amp; may end up with a dosing guidance later.
alt_fda,@alt_fda Years later U have a failing liver &amp; data, if looked at in review, shows Drug X is likely the cause.
alt_fda,@alt_fda Example for this approval method. U have chronic debilitating pain. Drug X is prescribed in a dose that lessens it.
alt_fda,@alt_fda 2nd method- improvement in clinical signs &amp; symptoms
alt_fda,@alt_fda Biomarker approval says that's ok, drug X works. Migraines may B outside factor as stress of the subject. No further testing needed
alt_fda,@alt_fda 
Test show reduction in bilirubin but U have debilitating migraines while taking drug X.
alt_fda,@alt_fda Let's give an example to how biomarkers would work. Treating jaundice w/ drug X.
alt_fda,@alt_fda The first method- Biomarkers. If U don't know what biomarkers r. 
https://t.co/Q3fjsIHpyL
alt_fda,@alt_fda Now that U R up to speed let's skip ahead in the article 2 address the 4 proposed drug approvals Joe wants.

alt_fda,@alt_fda Due 2 all of this we would argue that protection is where we need to focus &amp; if U want a faster FDA, modernize us.
alt_fda,@alt_fda We are on the verge of individual directed drug treatments &amp; the FDA is still processing/ managing data w/ 20th century tech.
alt_fda,@alt_fda Computer processing &amp; tech now allow companies the ability to pursue an ever increasing variety of complex drug formulations.
alt_fda,@alt_fda Many drugs are stopped even before a beaker gets wet because they do not fit a profit model.
alt_fda,@alt_fda They are also being used for cost analysis or producing a drug. Including potential suit cost &amp; profit margins.
alt_fda,@alt_fda Statistical models can calculate not only potential drug hazards with current data set sizes by incorporating old data...
alt_fda,@alt_fda We r in great need of nxt gen antibiotics but profits cannot B realized from those currently.
alt_fda,@alt_fda Marketing is driving drug production at all levels in the industry.
alt_fda,@alt_fda 
Companies are mining big data to find potential drug markets. This the lead in speciality drugs, not need.
alt_fda,@alt_fda 2- Emergence of big data, statistical modeling &amp; computers/ tech. At no other time have we had the ability 2 process big data.
alt_fda,@alt_fda Each change of asset opens potential 4 violations.
alt_fda,@alt_fda 1- growth in the industry is currently artificial. Companies r purchasing &amp; divesting for profits.
alt_fda,@alt_fda Currently there are 2 major changes going on in the pharma industry that require a protection stand point.
alt_fda,@alt_fda Here is a time line of significant FDA moments in history. https://t.co/ngISbw3zc4 In it U can see the change in responses 2 need.
alt_fda,@alt_fda The FDA has shifted from protection 2 promotion 2 protection... over its life in response 2 regulation needs.
alt_fda,@alt_fda 2 say that there is a lack of historical context here is obvious &amp; makes 4 a "false flag" argument 2 advance from.
alt_fda,@alt_fda Back 2 R discussion from yesterday. Joe starts out by calling 4 a shift in FDA focus. From protecting health 2 promoting.
alt_fda,Happy hump day ppl. We R discussing a betting pool. Will budget talks keep the FDA from a nomination? #Thread

alt_fda,@alt_fda Now that we have a context to view Joe's comments and stand point from. 2mrow we will get into his points of change.
alt_fda,@alt_fda 
It is doubtful that these reductions in cost here will B fully passed onto the consumer.
alt_fda,@alt_fda This will reduce the bottom line 4 companies while minimizing first lines of defense.
alt_fda,@alt_fda While de-reg may start with us, it will end up in QC/QA depts. of companies.
alt_fda,@alt_fda QC &amp; QA (quality control &amp; quality assurance) depts industry wide R non-value added assets. I.E. they R cost centers on the books.
alt_fda,@alt_fda The customers that Joe is speaking of is not the purchaser of the products, it's the stock holders &amp; company's value in profits.
alt_fda,@alt_fda This is going to sound jaded but those of you on the corporate side of pharma will back us up.
alt_fda,@alt_fda Let's start this discussion with a framing that Joe would like "market-centric" &amp; providing better value to customers.
alt_fda,@alt_fda The article states that Joe is probably the likely contender for the job. He is working the art of the deal with POTUS.

alt_fda,@alt_fda ...but we cannot stop you from skinning your knee. Only look at it later. Then look at where &amp; why it happened. Maybe stop it then.

alt_fda,@alt_fda ...But in the current climate of de-reg. the FDA has the power to push deadlines out farther &amp; farther.
alt_fda,@alt_fda What in the end does all this mean for u &amp; me? The system will in time be worked out &amp; we will have stronger food regs. But...
alt_fda,@alt_fda This problem is compounded the farther you travel down the line to the farmer &amp; the delays bare fruit of this. Pun intended.
alt_fda,@alt_fda _______ who makes regional potato chips has no idea what his micro testing schedule should be nor does he know how to report it.
alt_fda,@alt_fda Big food will have no problem meeting the requirements &amp; have had few delays. The problems r arising in the 2&amp;3 tier companies.
alt_fda,@alt_fda Now that you understand that, you can see the issues at had. These problems have pushed back compliance deadlines on many levels.
alt_fda,@alt_fda Only 2 keep telling U that it's wrong till U do it like or better than _, all without directly telling you how 2 do it. #guidance!
alt_fda,@alt_fda ... "oh, __ does it like this" implying that ur doing it all wrong.
alt_fda,@alt_fda Those not in pharma a guidance is when ur mate sees what U R doing &amp; then says...
alt_fda,@alt_fda Those that are in pharma understand how every time you hear the word guidance, you also hear General Ackbar "It's a Traaaaap".
alt_fda,@alt_fda The FDA on its part has only come so far in understanding this. The main problems are in reporting &amp; guidance.
alt_fda,@alt_fda The Food ind. did not &amp; is no longer speaking the same language of tracking, testing &amp; reporting.
alt_fda,@alt_fda This however is where problems come. Pharma evolved with the FDA in tracking, approving &amp; testing products from raw 2 finished.
alt_fda,@alt_fda The FSMA follows the same reg model that is used in pharma &amp; that makes a lot of sense. Their tracking &amp; testing of product- proven
alt_fda,@alt_fda The grand view of the act, it's great! Not without issues but they r "small &amp; being worked on". 
What it is https://t.co/rwbqADrzXY

alt_fda,@kcdubz we are not familiar with that supplement but will be discussing supplements &amp; vitamins Thursday.
alt_fda,@TheGZeus Yup phrasing could be better. 120 charterers is a limit on full sentences also.
alt_fda,@IdealistAmerica Probably not at this time. It's hard to say.
alt_fda,@reason_rising do you mean in the plant? It's a naturally occurring compound. PEG is in almost all commercial e-cigs. It's very stable.
alt_fda,@ariherzog yes, to keep all the tweets in a linking series.
alt_fda,@alt_fda With that we R done talking about #vaping. Take ur arm pit crystal &amp; essential oils &amp; learn to be safer. K? #protectyourself
alt_fda,@alt_fda Do you feel safe putting your life in the hands of a guy with plastic equipment &amp; a pickle jar? That's what was going on.
alt_fda,@alt_fda Are you understanding now what the regs are after? They are asking these and many more questions to keep you safe.
alt_fda,@alt_fda Is ur maker trained in science? Can they tell U what a meniscus is? How 2 calculate dilutions? Or is @BillNye just a guy?
alt_fda,@alt_fda Is the flavoring ethanol based? We're not fans of vaporizing any flammable liquid next to R face, R U?
alt_fda,@alt_fda About the flavoring, is it food safe &amp; what's it's dilution recommendations? Improperly diluted, It can burn U like a hot pocket!
alt_fda,@alt_fda Is the diluent certified food grade or it just doesn't say? Is licking a water fountain safe? Same question...
alt_fda,@alt_fda What is the diluent for the nicotine? PEG, EG, H2O? One is in toothpaste, one is in ur car &amp; hopefully the last is in U.
alt_fda,@alt_fda R they using a balance 2 weigh the nicotine? Is it calibrated &amp; tracked 4 certification? R they weighing within 10% of its limits?
alt_fda,@alt_fda What lab ware R they using in the prep? Is it class A or a good pickle jar. Class A has certified measurements, pickle jars don't.
alt_fda,@alt_fda What purity is the sellers nicotine? Does it come with a CoA? Purity dictates the dissolution. Sellers should know what a CoA is.
alt_fda,@alt_fda What is the lethal dose of pure nicotine? It's 30-80mg FYI. Or less than a baby aspirin.
alt_fda,@alt_fda We R going to assume U R buying ur e-juice &amp; will be asking Q's that you should be asking ur seller.
alt_fda,@alt_fda Making e-juice is not like mixing essential oils. Miss calculations do compound and you will alter your DNA by being dead.
alt_fda,@alt_fda First off the vaping regs were not designed to empower big tobacco. Their intent is to protect you from untrained blenders.
alt_fda,@alt_fda We do find this topic tiresome &amp; R going to B snarky about it. So, let's discuss vaping once &amp; then move on, shall we?
alt_fda,We have been getting a lot of request to discuss the vaping regs. So many that we feel the FDA Tobacco is not answering ppl.
alt_fda,@sextonrm yup

alt_fda,@StubbornOldBuzz keep trying, change is in the wind.
alt_fda,@PoetQs The life of a patent is a large amount of time to make a profit from.
alt_fda,@StubbornOldBuzz That is a different fight by different ppl.
alt_fda,@falling_stone true
alt_fda,@SchorJudith yes, but because they own the original patent they can call it a reformulation and keep it off the generic list.
alt_fda,@alt_fda This sometimes prevents the drug from entering the generic market there by lowering cost.
alt_fda,@alt_fda 3- Single patent filing. Before a drug comes off patent, drug makers will file new formulations to re-issue the patent.
alt_fda,@alt_fda A drug w/ isomers in the formulation may treat something completely different but will not be explored due 2 its patent listing.
alt_fda,@alt_fda This burdens the Patent Office for approval as they have to search all of these to prevent patent infringement.
alt_fda,@alt_fda These formulations are never proven to be the same chemical compound.
alt_fda,@alt_fda These "alternate" formulations are used to hinder competition with endless patent infringement lawsuits.
alt_fda,@alt_fda 2- Proven formulation patents. Pharma will sometimes include 100 chemical formulations 4 the same drug in a patent.
alt_fda,@alt_fda 
Without an increase in sample sets and trial sizes, we will not know which until after the drug hits the market.
alt_fda,@alt_fda @alt_fda these outlying data points often predict trends that are not seen without time or amount of use. They could be good or bad
alt_fda,@alt_fda 1- Study sizes need to increase. A shorter study at current size requirements downplays outlying data points.
alt_fda,Let's start with this article &amp; faster approval of drugs. It can be done safely if key items are addressed.

alt_fda,@alt_fda The hiring freeze plays into this very well, preventing the FDA from placing on site inspectors.

ActualEPAFacts,We love your commentary @ChrisMurphyCT. We made your rant into a thread. We appreciate you. May want to RT this so… https://t.co/GOALKZzlX7
ActualEPAFacts,(6) Last rant, for now. If you're older, your premiums go WAY up. GOP plan guts premium protections for older consumers.
ActualEPAFacts,(5) Oh, and Medicaid expansion is effectively GONE. Millions and millions lose coverage, start using ERs again for health care. Others die.
ActualEPAFacts,(4) Mandatory benefits are repealed. So even if you CAN get insurance, it doesn't have to cover ANYTHING. Out of pocket expenses skyrocket.
ActualEPAFacts,(3) Coverage mandates and penalties only work if you make insurance affordable. GOP plan cuts subsidies so much that penalty is unworkable.
ActualEPAFacts,(2) It gets worse. When u can't afford your premiums bc the tax credit is too small, you get a huge penalty when you try to sign up again.
ActualEPAFacts,(1) You get a couple thousand bucks to help u buy insurance. That's it. If u aren't rich or healthy, u won't be able to afford anything.
ActualEPAFacts,Let me count thy ways that the leaked GOP ACA repeal plan will totally, completely, monumentally screw you. @ChrisMurphyCT

NotAltWorld,Thanks @GeorgeTakei, we're big fans!  Very much appreciate your support. We promise to continue promoting science, nature and discovery!
NotAltWorld,Meanwhile, this article should help guide our comradely 'Alt' accounts in managing their own going forward. https://t.co/foBtSzZWCo
NotAltWorld,So, in the spirit of continuing with a new user team, we'd like you to design our new Twitter logo. 

Not one of us can actually draw :/
NotAltWorld,One aspect we've had to consider over the past few days are legal ramifications, such as criminal prosecution for the use of the NPA's logo.
NotAltWorld,Just checking....Yup....we've got more scientists and fact checkers running a Twitter account than Donald Trump has in his cabinet.
NotAltWorld,Several of us are environmental activists and two are journalists [our FACT checkers]. All of us are former scientists.
NotAltWorld,We believe that today in Trump's America, science and the environment have a place at the forefront of society and policy.
NotAltWorld,Several of us advised in the creation and running of this 'Alt' account following discussions a few days ago.
NotAltWorld,Hello all!

We have taken over the group and will continue to run this account, advocating scientific and environmental interests.
NotAltWorld,Pay us a visit sometime!

NotAltWorld,“The saddest aspect of life right now is that science gathers knowledge faster than society gathers wisdom.”
 
― Isaac Asimov
NotAltWorld,You have the power, the authority, and the resources to make the best of our country and this world. Don't squander it.
NotAltWorld,Climate change is real, Trump. You gotta deal with it now, or have the problems it creates be your legacy, for now &amp; future generations.
NotAltWorld,To all our colleagues. We've heard the jokes going round. You'll never know but we're glad to have brought some laughter at this time.
NotAltWorld,But we are assured &amp; comforted that those taking over will not identify us to the media. We asked to remain unknown &amp; they have promised.
NotAltWorld,It's too easy to expose ourselves &amp; enjoy the 30 minutes of applause before the eventual repercussions. We haven't slept much this week.
NotAltWorld,The individuals taking over come from various countries, but all have a science background &amp; are fearful about a Trump administration.
NotAltWorld,We'd like to thank the anonymous members of the Reddit community who helped us get the ball rolling &amp; assist with a safe transfer of control
NotAltWorld,As such, we are handing control of this account over to several activists &amp; journalists who believe they can continue in the same spirit.
NotAltWorld,They haven't won &amp; we haven't lost., &amp; you have proven that this country believes in the serious work undertaken by our scientists.
NotAltWorld,But we cannot escape the pressure that the popularity of this account has brought on our colleagues. It's selfish to continue ourselves.
NotAltWorld,The past few days have proven the immense belief &amp; support this country has in our national parks, environment and scientific departments.
NotAltWorld,We have decided to pass over control of this account to individuals outside of government employment for the sake of our colleagues.
NotAltWorld,We cannot confirm which species has the smallest hands.
New specimens are being found daily by scientists around the world.

NotAltWorld,Since then the park service tweets have been about park news and scenery. South Dakota park then posted tweets about climate science data.
NotAltWorld,But the accounts were reactivated the next day after an apology for "mistaken" retweets.
NotAltWorld,The park service had retweeted photos about turnout at President Donald Trump's inauguration.
